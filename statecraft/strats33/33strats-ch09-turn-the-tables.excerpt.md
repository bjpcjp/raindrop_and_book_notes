The counterattack strategy emphasizes the power of patience and holding back, allowing an opponent's aggression and mistakes to create openings for a decisive and unexpected offensive maneuver. By blending defense and offense, masking weakness to bait the enemy, and exploiting their impatience and overconfidence, one can turn seemingly desperate situations to oneâ€™s advantage and achieve victory through subtlety and timing.

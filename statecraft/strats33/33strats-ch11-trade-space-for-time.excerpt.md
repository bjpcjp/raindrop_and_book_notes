Retreating in the face of a stronger enemy is a strategic act of strength that buys valuable time to recover, rethink, and gain perspective, often provoking the enemy into overextension and mistakes. By trading space for time and refusing to engage directly, a weaker force preserves itself, builds inner strength, and can ultimately turn the tide in its favor when the moment to fight returns.

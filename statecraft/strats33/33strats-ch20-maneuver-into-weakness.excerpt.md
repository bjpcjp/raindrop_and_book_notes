Maneuver warfare emphasizes strategic positioning, flexibility, and psychological tactics to place opponents in weak, confusing dilemmas rather than relying on direct attrition and brute force, enabling decisive victories with minimal cost. Through careful planning, creating disorder, and exploiting enemy reactions, maneuver commanders like Napoleon, T.E. Lawrence, and Roosevelt exemplify how controlling the flow of conflict and maintaining adaptability leads to effective and sustainable success.

Napoleon's revolutionary strategy in warfare hinged on breaking his forces into independent, flexible corps that could operate and make decisions autonomously, enabling speed, adaptability, and the creation of strategic opportunities. This decentralized approach, later institutionalized in concepts like the German Auftragstaktik, proved more effective than rigid, centralized command by empowering subordinate leaders and fostering mobility, creativity, and cohesion within the army.

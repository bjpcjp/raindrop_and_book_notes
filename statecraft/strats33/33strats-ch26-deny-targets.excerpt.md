Guerrilla warfare exploits the human aversion to emptiness and nonengagement by denying opponents tangible targets, using elusive, small-scale attacks to frustrate, exhaust, and psychologically unravel larger, conventional forces. This strategy, demonstrated in history by Russia against Napoleon and refined through time, thrives on mobility, time, and space to wear down enemies politically and militarily, often making it virtually unbeatable unless met with swift, decisive counteraction.

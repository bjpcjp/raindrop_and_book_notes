Envelopment is a strategy of applying relentless, multi-directional pressure to surround and psychologically dominate an opponent, leaving them no room to maneuver or hope for counterattack. History shows that successful envelopment exploits the enemyâ€™s vulnerabilities and mindset to crush their willpower, making defeat inevitable even against technologically superior foes.

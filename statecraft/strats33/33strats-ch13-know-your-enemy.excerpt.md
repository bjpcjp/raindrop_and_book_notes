Effective strategy hinges on understanding and manipulating the mindset of your opponent rather than merely confronting their forces, as demonstrated by historical examples like the British invasion of Afghanistan and Napoleon's dealings with Metternich. By closely observing behavioral signals, overcoming personal biases, and maintaining unpredictability, one can uncover psychological vulnerabilities and control the adversaryâ€™s decisions, thereby gaining decisive advantage.

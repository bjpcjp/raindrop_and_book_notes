The blitzkrieg strategy emphasizes overwhelming opponents with unexpected speed and suddenness, using a deliberate setup of slow preparation followed by rapid, coordinated attacks to exploit weaknesses and induce panic. This approach, demonstrated by historical figures like Genghis Khan and Julius Caesar, succeeds by breaking enemy defenses before they can react, while also inspiring momentum and morale within one's own forces.

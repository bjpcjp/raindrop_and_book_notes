The divide-and-conquer strategy emphasizes weakening a formidable enemy by isolating and defeating smaller parts individually, exploiting divisions within their ranks or between allied forces to gain a central position of control. This principle, demonstrated historically by figures like Napoleon, Miltiades, and Samuel Adams, relies on creating internal conflict, controlling key junctures, and maintaining cohesion within oneâ€™s own group to overcome larger or more powerful opponents.

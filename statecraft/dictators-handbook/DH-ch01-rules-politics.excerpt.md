Political power is never absolute or held unilaterally by leaders; rather, it depends on the size and management of three key groups—the nominal selectorate, the real selectorate, and the winning coalition—whose support determines a leader’s ability to govern. Effective leadership requires balancing these groups by keeping the winning coalition small, maintaining a large selectorate to allow replacements, controlling revenue flow, paying supporters just enough to ensure loyalty, and prioritizing support for essentials over broader public welfare.

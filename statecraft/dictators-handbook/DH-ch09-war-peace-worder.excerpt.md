This section draws on the selectorate theory and empirical studies to analyze the political incentives behind war, regime survival, and the dynamics of military power, illustrating how domestic political regimes influence leaders' decisions regarding conflict and occupation. Case studies and historical data, including examples from the Correlates of War Project and works by Bruce Bueno de Mesquita and others, highlight the complexities of war initiation, protection of soldiers, and the survival of political leaders across different regime types.

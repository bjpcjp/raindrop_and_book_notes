The process of coming to power involves removing the incumbent, quickly seizing the instruments of government, and forming a loyal coalition by offering sufficient rewards, often relying on timing, speed, and strategic coalition-building rather than good governance. While autocratic leaders maintain power through paying essential supporters and suppressing rivals, democratic leaders depend on winning broad support through policies, making politics a continual contest for loyalty and power that demands both opportunity and decisiveness.

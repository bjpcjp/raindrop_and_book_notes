Leaders allocate resources to balance the needs of their essential supporters and the general populace, with democracies dependent on large coalitions providing broad public goods and freedoms that enhance citizens' well-being, while autocracies with small coalitions restrict such benefits to maintain control. This dynamic explains why democracies typically offer higher quality education, health care, infrastructure, and political freedoms, whereas autocratic regimes prioritize private rewards for their limited supporters, often at the expense of the wider population.

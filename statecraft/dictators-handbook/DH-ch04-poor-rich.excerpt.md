Leaders maintain power by controlling revenue through taxation, resource extraction, and borrowing to reward their essential supporters, often taxing those outside the coalition disproportionately. While autocrats maximize revenue through opaque and coercive means, democracies face greater constraints due to larger coalitions and transparency, resulting in lower tax rates and less fiscal profligacy.

The strategy "Besiege Wei to Rescue Zhao" advocates attacking an enemy's vulnerable or valuable point while they are engaged elsewhere, forcing them to abandon their current campaign to defend what is threatened, thereby creating an opportunity to ambush and defeat their weakened forces. This approach, demonstrated through historical examples from the Warring States and Han Dynasty periods, emphasizes indirect confrontation to exploit weaknesses rather than costly direct battles.

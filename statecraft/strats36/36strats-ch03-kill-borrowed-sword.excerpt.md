"Kill With a Borrowed Sword" emphasizes using the strength and resources of others to achieve victory when direct action or sufficient personal power is lacking, employing tactics like deception and manipulation to neutralize enemies while conserving one’s own resources. Historical and folk examples illustrate how leveraging others’ power can lead to success, often through trickery or strategic influence.

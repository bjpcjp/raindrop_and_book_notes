The Art of War, attributed to Sun Tzu and translated by Lionel Giles, is an ancient Chinese military treatise consisting of 13 chapters that emphasize the importance of strategy, discipline, deception, and adaptability in war. The work underscores that victory stems not from sheer force but from careful planning, understanding both oneself and the enemy, and skillfully employing direct and indirect tactics while maintaining morale and cohesion within the army.

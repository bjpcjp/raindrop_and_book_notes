A battle requires mutual consent but is fundamentally driven by broader political and strategic objectives rather than mere willingness to fight, making the historical notion of one commander offering battle and the other refusing largely obsolete. In modern warfare, a defender can no longer outright refuse battle but may avoid it by retreating, while attackers must often resort to surrounding or surprising the enemy to compel engagement, though surprise attacks have become less effective due to improved troop mobility.

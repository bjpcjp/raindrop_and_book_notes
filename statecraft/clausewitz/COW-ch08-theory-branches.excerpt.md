The Art of War, in its proper sense, is the theory of using military forces in fighting, divided into tactics—the use of forces in individual combats—and strategy—the use of combats to achieve the ultimate object of war. Preparatory and maintenance activities, such as levying, equipping, subsisting, and administering troops, while closely related, are distinct from the conduct of war itself and should be excluded from the theory of its direct conduct.

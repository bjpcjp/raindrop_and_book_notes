Military virtue is a distinct moral power essential to standing armies, characterized by disciplined obedience, endurance, and a collective spirit forged through experience, victories, and sustained activity under capable generals. While natural qualities like bravery and enthusiasm can supplement or temporarily replace it, true military virtue arises only from the combined trials of war and leadership, enabling an army to persist through hardship beyond mere discipline or individual courage.

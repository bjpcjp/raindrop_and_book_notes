Criticism applies theoretical principles to real events by investigating causes, testing means, and evaluating outcomes to bridge theory and practice, requiring a sound theoretical foundation and the critic's talent to assess both actual and possible courses of action. It must balance objectivity with an understanding of actorsâ€™ knowledge and motives, avoid rigid doctrine and superficial use of theory, and maintain clear, accessible language free from technical jargon and irrelevant historical examples.

War’s ultimate objective is the disarmament of the enemy through the destruction of their military power, conquest of territory, and subjugation of their will, with combat as the sole means to achieve these ends. While complete destruction of the enemy’s forces is the most decisive method, varying political objectives and practical circumstances often lead to alternative approaches such as wearing out the enemy or targeting political alliances, all governed by the supreme law of decision by arms.

Methodicism in war refers to the reliance on established methods—chosen for their average probability of success—rather than strict principles or specific prescriptions, especially at lower ranks where freedom of action is limited. While methods enhance readiness and coordination, overdependence on them, particularly at higher command levels, can lead to rigid actions unsuited to unique situations, highlighting the need for theory and individual judgment to guide their application.

The geometrical element plays a predominant and decisive role in fortification and tactics, particularly in the immediate tactical aim to surround the enemy, but its influence diminishes significantly in strategy due to greater space, time, and the importance of multiple victorious combats over geometric form. While modern theory often overemphasizes geometry to ennoble strategy, the practical reality is that strategy relies more on the number and scale of victories than on the geometric arrangement of forces.

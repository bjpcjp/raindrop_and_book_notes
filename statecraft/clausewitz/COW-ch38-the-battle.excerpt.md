A battle is the decisive conflict of the main armies fought with all forces to achieve a decisive victory, distinguished from lesser engagements by its sole purpose and the necessity of striving to the end as long as hope remains. The moment to give up arises primarily from the depletion of fresh reserves making further effort futile, with retreat often prompted by increasing danger or nightfall, and commanders must balance courage with reason to avoid desperate folly.

Modern battles are characterized by large masses of troops engaging in prolonged fire-combat with periodic small charges, gradually wearing down the enemy until nightfall or exhaustion determines the outcome. This pattern arises because opposing forces are nearly equal in military organization and skill, leading to battles that maintain this slow, attritional nature in great, decisive combats.

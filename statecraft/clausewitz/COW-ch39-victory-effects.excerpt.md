The effect of a great victory profoundly influences both the defeated and the victor, primarily impacting the morale and physical strength of armies, with the vanquished suffering greater losses and demoralization that often lead to further weakening. While victory can shift the balance in a campaign decisively, its ultimate consequences depend on the character and decisions of commanders, the stateâ€™s military power, and external circumstances, making the moral effects of victory indispensable and unavoidable in war.

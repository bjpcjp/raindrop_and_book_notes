Military genius is defined not by a single quality but by a harmonious association of intellectual and moral powers, including courage, resolution, presence of mind, and a strong sense of locality, all necessary to navigate the dangers, uncertainties, and complexities of War. The highest form of military genius arises in those who combine comprehensive, searching minds with steady temperament and strength of character, enabling them to make rapid, sound decisions and maintain command under pressure, especially at the level of Commander-in-Chief where war and state policy intersect.

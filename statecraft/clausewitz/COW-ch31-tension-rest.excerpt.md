War alternates between phases of equilibrium, where both sides remain inactive or only engage in limited actions, and phases of tension, where active measures aimed at achieving objectives lead to decisive movements. The importance and impact of actions taken during tension far exceed those conducted in equilibrium, making the state of crisis the true essence of war, while equilibrium is merely its reflection.

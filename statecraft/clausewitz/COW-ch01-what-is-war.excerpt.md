War is an act of violence intended to compel an opponent to submit to oneâ€™s will, characterized by reciprocal actions that push the use of force toward extremes, yet always moderated by political objectives, human factors, and the interplay of chance. It is simultaneously driven by instinctive hostility, governed by probabilities and strategy, and remains a serious political instrument rather than a mere exercise of force.

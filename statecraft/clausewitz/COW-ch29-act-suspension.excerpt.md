War, viewed as an act of mutual destruction, inherently involves one side advancing while the other waits, as circumstances never favor both simultaneously; despite this natural impetus for continuous action, factors such as human timidity, imperfect knowledge, and the stronger defensive position often cause prolonged periods of inactivity or cautious maneuvering. Consequently, while war ideally demands relentless energy and progress, historical practice frequently reflects intermittent movements shaped by political objectives and the balance between offensive and defensive forces.

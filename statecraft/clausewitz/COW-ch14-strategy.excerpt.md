Strategy is defined as the employment of battle to achieve the objective of war, requiring continuous adjustment and coordination of military actions to align with political goals. While its means are simple and well-known, successful execution demands exceptional willpower, clarity, and the capacity to integrate both material and moral forces in the dynamic conditions of warfare.

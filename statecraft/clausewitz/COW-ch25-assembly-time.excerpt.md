In Strategy, all available forces should be applied simultaneously to achieve a complete and decisive effect, as the gradual or successive use of troops diminishes neither their strength nor the strategic result. Unlike tactics, where time and exhaustion reduce fighting power, strategic operations benefit from mass and continuous development of new forces, emphasizing the importance of deploying strength at once rather than in segments.

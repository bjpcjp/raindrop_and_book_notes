The duration of combat is a strategic element influenced by factors such as the absolute magnitude of force, the relation of different arms, and the nature of the country, with longer resistance often serving as a relative defense. Experience shows that the length of a combat depends on the size of forces involved, lasting from several hours for a division to several times longer for an army, during which reinforcements can arrive to influence the outcome.

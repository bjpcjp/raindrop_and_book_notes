Night attacks are strategically limited mainly to small-scale operations against portions of an enemy force, relying on surprise and superior numbers to achieve advantage, as large-scale night battles are rarely feasible due to difficulties in reconnaissance, coordination, and the defender's familiarity with the terrain. Such attacks typically occur under exceptional circumstances like enemy panic, audacity, or necessity, and generally only the approach or initial assault is conducted in darkness, with the main combat resolving at daylight.

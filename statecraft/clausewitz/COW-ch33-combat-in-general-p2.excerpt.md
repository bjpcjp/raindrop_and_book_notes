The true objective of combat is the direct and relative destruction of the enemy’s army, measured not only by physical losses but chiefly by moral force, which determines the ability to continue fighting and often manifests most clearly in the enemy’s retreat and the capturing of prisoners and artillery. Victory thus encompasses greater enemy losses in physical and moral power and their open acknowledgment of defeat, with the moral effects often outweighing immediate physical damage and influencing the course of the campaign beyond the battlefield.

A combat, as a part of War, primarily aims at the destruction of the enemy’s military forces, though it may also serve to conquer or defend places or objects, or to mislead the enemy through reconnaissances and demonstrations. The significance and nature of a combat’s objective influence tactical dispositions, with battles focused solely on defending places or objects often indicating a strategically unfavorable situation.

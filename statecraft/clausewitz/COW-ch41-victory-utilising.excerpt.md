The true value of a victory in war is determined not merely by the battle itself but by the subsequent pursuit, which must be vigorous and strategic to convert a win into decisive destruction of the enemy's forces. While physical exhaustion and human nature often constrain generals from fully exploiting victory, relentless pursuit—whether by cavalry, advance-guards, or the main army—is essential to prevent the enemy from regrouping, thereby maximizing the triumph’s impact and hastening the enemy’s collapse.

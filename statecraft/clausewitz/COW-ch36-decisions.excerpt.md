The decisive moment in battle occurs when the victor restores order and efficiency, making further efforts by the opponent ineffective, and while reinforcements arriving from the flank or rear can have a significant moral and tactical impact, a recovered battle depends on whether the contest is genuinely ongoing or already decided. Consequently, commanders must carefully assess whether renewing combat is possible or advantageous, considering the conditions of their forces, the terrain, and the psychological state of troops to avoid futile sacrifices and maximize the chance of ultimate victory.

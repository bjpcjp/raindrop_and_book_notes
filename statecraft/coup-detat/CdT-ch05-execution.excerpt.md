The execution of a coup d’état demands precise, rapid coordination to seize strategic targets and neutralize loyalist forces before they can mount effective resistance, relying on detailed pre-planning and simultaneous actions by small, specialized teams. Following physical control, the coup leaders must stabilize their forces, bureaucracy, and public acceptance through a combination of defensive tactics, communication control, political accommodation, and information campaigns to legitimize their authority and minimize opposition.

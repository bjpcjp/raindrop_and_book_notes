A coup d’état is the infiltration of a small but critical segment of the state apparatus used to displace the government’s control of the remainder, relying on the state’s permanent machinery rather than mass intervention or warfare. Unlike revolutions or putsch attempts, coups are politically neutral and exploit the structured hierarchies and predictable behavior of modern state bureaucracies and armed forces to seize power.

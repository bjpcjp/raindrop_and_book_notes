The planning of a successful coup d’état requires not only the seizure of military power but also the neutralization of political forces through control of key government personalities, mass media, communications, transport links, and influential organizations such as religious groups, political parties, and trade unions. Failure to account for the political infrastructure and to isolate or suppress potential opposition can lead to the coup’s collapse, as illustrated by the Algiers coup of 1961.

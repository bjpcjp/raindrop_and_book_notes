A coup d’état is most feasible in economically backward countries where political participation is limited to a small elite, the state maintains substantial independence from foreign powers, and political power is concentrated in a clearly identifiable central authority rather than diffuse among regional, ethnic, or sectional forces. Under such conditions, the general population and lower bureaucracy typically remain passive, allowing coup plotters to seize power with minimal resistance, unlike in politically sophisticated societies where active public engagement and legitimacy uphold stable governance.

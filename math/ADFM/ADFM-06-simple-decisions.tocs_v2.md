- **6 Simple Decisions**
  - **6.1 Constraints on Rational Preferences**
    - Rational preferences follow completeness, transitivity, continuity, and independence constraints.
    - These constraints are necessary for defining rational decisions under uncertainty.
    - The von Neumann-Morgenstern axioms formalize these constraints; see [Theory of Games and Economic Behavior](https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691130613/theory-of-games-and-economic-behavior).
  - **6.2 Utility Functions**
    - Rational preferences imply the existence of a real-valued utility function unique up to positive affine transformation.
    - The utility of lotteries equals the expected utility calculated from constituent outcomes.
    - See Schoemaker's survey on utility theory for foundational background.
  - **6.3 Utility Elicitation**
    - Utility functions can be inferred by eliciting indifference probabilities between outcomes and lotteries.
    - Monetary values are not a reliable utility proxy due to nonlinearity of wealth utility; risk aversion modifies utility shapes.
    - Relevant methods are surveyed by [Utility Assessment Methods](https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.30.11.1283).
  - **6.4 Maximum Expected Utility Principle**
    - A rational decision maximizes expected utility given observations and probabilistic models.
    - Expected utility is computed as the sum of utilities weighted by conditional outcome probabilities.
    - See [Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach](https://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/) for AI perspectives.
  - **6.5 Decision Networks**
    - Decision networks augment Bayesian networks with decision and utility nodes to compactly represent decision problems.
    - Nodes include chance (random variables), decision (actions), and utility nodes; edges represent probabilistic, informational, or functional relations.
    - Algorithms for evaluation involve iterating over decision assignments and performing Bayesian inference; see [Bayesian Networks and Decision Graphs](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-0-387-68282-1).
  - **6.6 Value of Information**
    - Value of information quantifies the expected increase in utility from observing additional variables.
    - It is computed by comparing expected utilities before and after conditioning on the new observation.
    - The value of information is always nonnegative and can guide sequential observations; see Howard (1966), [Information Value Theory](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4103122).
  - **6.7 Irrationality**
    - Empirical studies reveal humans often violate rational utility theory axioms, exhibiting certainty and framing effects.
    - These violations include preference inconsistencies as shown by Tversky and Kahnemanâ€™s experiments.
    - Prospect theory provides an alternative model better aligned with observed human behavior; see [Prospect Theory](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1914185).
  - **6.8 Summary**
    - Rational decision making integrates probability and utility theory.
    - Utility functions arise from rational preference constraints.
    - Decision networks model decisions and utilities compactly but solving them is NP-hard.
    - Value of information shapes observation strategies but human decisions can deviate from rationality.
  - **6.9 Exercises**
    - Exercises cover utility normalization, lotteries, utility transformations, power utility risk aversion proof, expected utility calculation, and value of information computation.
    - Solutions illustrate application of theory to practical decision examples such as umbrella bringing and puppy feeding.
    - Exercises facilitate deeper understanding of decision theory principles and computational methods.

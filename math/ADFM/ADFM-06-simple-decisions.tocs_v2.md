- 6 Simple Decisions  
  - 6.1 Constraints on Rational Preferences  
    The four constraints on rational preferences are completeness, transitivity, continuity, and independence. These conditions ensure the existence of a utility function that models preferences as a real-valued function over uncertain outcomes. The axioms underlie the von Neumann-Morgenstern framework, foundational in expected utility theory. For in-depth theory, see [Schoemaker 1982](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2722734).  
  - 6.2 Utility Functions  
    Rational preferences imply the existence of a utility function U matching preference orderings, unique up to a positive affine transformation. Utility of lotteries equals the expectation of utility over outcomes. This formalizes rational decision-making under uncertainty. A foundational reference is Bernoulli's original work [Bernoulli 1954 translation](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1907240).  
  - 6.3 Utility Elicitation  
    Utility elicitation infers utility functions from human judgments using constructed lotteries and preference queries, typically normalizing utilities between 0 and 1. Monetary values are not always adequate due to nonlinearity of utility of wealth, as demonstrated by risk-aversion behaviors. Detailed methods are surveyed in [Farquhar 1984](https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.30.11.1283).  
  - 6.4 Maximum Expected Utility Principle  
    This principle prescribes that rational agents choose actions maximizing expected utility, computed from probabilistic beliefs about outcomes and their utilities. It serves as the fundamental decision-making criterion in the presence of uncertainty. For a full treatment, see [Peterson 2009](https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511804774).  
  - 6.5 Decision Networks  
    Decision networks extend Bayesian networks by including decision and utility nodes, modeling decision problems with chance nodes, actions, and utilities. Solving them entails evaluating expected utilities for all decisions given observations, which is generally NP-hard. Algorithms by Shachter (1986, 1988) provide foundational methods; see [Jensen & Nielsen 2007](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-0-387-68282-7) for comprehensive discussion.  
  - 6.6 Value of Information  
    Value of information quantifies the expected utility gain from observing additional variables before making decisions. It is computed as the difference between expected utility with and without the information, never negative, and guides observation choices when considering observation costs. Howard (1966) first formalized information value; see [Howard 1966](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4054414).  
  - 6.7 Irrationality  
    Empirical evidence shows human preferences often violate rationality axioms, exhibiting phenomena such as the certainty effect and framing effect. These deviations challenge expected utility theory's descriptive accuracy, motivating alternative models like prospect theory. For critique and alternatives, consult [Kahneman & Tversky 1979](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1914185) and Ariely (2008).  
  - 6.8 Summary  
    Rational decision making merges probability with utility theory, relying on utility function existence from preference constraints. Decisions maximize expected utility and can be modeled with decision networks. Solving involves Bayesian inference and is computationally hard; value of information guides observation. Recognizing human irrationality remains important for practical decision systems.  
  - 6.9 Exercises  
    The exercises apply theoretical concepts including normalization of utilities, lotteries inducing indifference, affine transformations preserving preference, risk aversion proofs, expected utility calculations, and value of information computations. Solutions demonstrate practical application of utility theory to decision problems and networks. Supplementary materials include decision theory textbooks and foundational papers.

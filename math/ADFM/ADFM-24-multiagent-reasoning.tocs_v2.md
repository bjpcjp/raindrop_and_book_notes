- Multiagent Reasoning
  - Simple Games
    - The simple game model consists of multiple agents each selecting actions to maximize their own rewards, combining into joint actions with joint reward functions. These games have no states or transitions, and common examples include the prisoner's dilemma and rock-paper-scissors. The joint policy can be deterministic (pure strategy) or stochastic (mixed strategy), with utilities computed over joint action spaces.

  - Response Models
    - Best response defines an agent's optimal policy against fixed policies of other agents by maximizing expected utility, computed straightforwardly for deterministic policies. The softmax response models bounded rationality by probabilistically selecting actions based on exponential utility weighting, regulated by a precision parameter. This allows modeling human-like errors and supports learning from data. Further reading: [Game Theory, Fudenberg and Tirole](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/game-theory).
  - Nash Equilibrium
    - A Nash equilibrium is a joint policy where no agent can increase their utility by unilaterally deviating, guaranteed to exist in finite action spaces. Computing a Nash equilibrium is computationally challenging (PPAD-complete). Examples include mutual defection in the prisoner's dilemma and uniform random play in rock-paper-scissors. It can be formulated as a nonlinear optimization problem with constraints ensuring best responses for each agent.

  - Correlated Equilibrium
    - Correlated equilibria generalize Nash equilibria by allowing joint distributions over actions that may be correlated among agents, enabling coordination beyond independent strategies. Every Nash equilibrium is also a correlated equilibrium, but not vice versa. Correlated equilibria can be efficiently computed via linear programming subject to incentive constraints. Objectives for selecting equilibria include utilitarian, egalitarian, plutocratic, and dictatorial criteria.

  - Iterated Best Response
    - Iterated best response iteratively updates each agent's policy to its best response against others' current policies, cycling through agents for a fixed number of iterations. This approach may converge to a Nash equilibrium in certain classes of games but can exhibit cycles otherwise. It serves as a computationally simpler heuristic for approximate equilibrium computation.

  - Hierarchical Softmax
    - The hierarchical softmax model captures bounded rationality by modeling agents at different levels of rationality depth, where level-0 acts uniformly at random, and level-k agents best respond via softmax to level-(k-1) agents. The precision parameter influences sensitivity to utility differences. Parameters can be learned from observed joint actions using maximum likelihood or Bayesian approaches. This model helps predict human behavior beyond equilibrium analysis.

  - Fictitious Play
    - Fictitious play is a learning algorithm where agents maintain counts of others' observed actions, estimate their policies via maximum likelihood, and play best responses accordingly. Agents iteratively update action counts and policies based on joint actions observed in repeated simulation. Although it may converge to Nash equilibria, convergence is not guaranteed. Variants include smooth fictitious play and Bayesian rational learning. Further reading: [Brownâ€™s Original Fictitious Play, Berger](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jet.2007.07.002).

- **Policy Validation**
  - **Performance Metric Evaluation**
    - Performance metrics for policies are expectations of trajectory metrics over state-action trajectories.
    - Collision avoidance and portfolio investment examples illustrate evaluation of safety and return probabilities.
    - Policy evaluation algorithms can compute value functions for any additive step-wise performance metric.
    - Sampling methods estimate overall performance when state spaces are large or continuous.
    - Accurate estimates and confidence intervals depend on sufficient sample size and high variance can occur with rare events.
    - Relevant further reading: A. Ruszczyński, “Risk-Averse Dynamic Programming for Markov Decision Processes.”
  - **Rare Event Simulation**
    - Direct sampling can be inefficient when estimating rare event probabilities such as collisions.
    - Importance sampling uses an alternative proposal distribution to generate informative samples and weight them for unbiased estimates.
    - The optimal proposal distribution scales with the absolute value of the trajectory metric times the trajectory probability.
    - Importance sampling can substantially reduce sample requirements by focusing on critical initial states or transitions.
    - For introduction to importance sampling, see J. A. Bucklew, *Introduction to Rare Event Simulation*.
  - **Robustness Analysis**
    - Policies can be evaluated on environments that deviate from the assumed optimization model to assess robustness.
    - Stress testing includes evaluating policies under extreme but plausible scenarios to identify potential failure modes.
    - Using simpler planning models can prevent overfitting but necessitates robust evaluation models for accurate assessment.
    - Robust dynamic programming optimizes policies against a set of transition and reward models rather than a single model.

  - **Trade Analysis**
    - Trade analysis studies how varying design parameters affect multiple competing objectives, e.g., safety vs. efficiency.
    - Pareto optimal policies are those not dominated by any others across multiple performance metrics.
    - Visualization of tradeoff curves enables informed selection of design points balancing safety and advisory frequency.
    - Pareto frontiers assist in eliminating suboptimal policies and comparing policy generation methodologies.
    - Classical concept: Vilfredo Pareto, Italian economist.
  - **Adversarial Analysis**
    - Adversarial analysis models an adversary selecting transitions to minimize policy returns while maximizing trajectory likelihood.
    - Transforming to adversarial MDPs allows use of dynamic programming or approximate solvers to find worst-case scenarios.
    - Defining failure states can enable identification of most likely failure trajectories to evaluate system risk.
    - Actions to mitigate failures include changing action/reward models, improving solvers, or not deploying unsafe policies.
    - Methodologies exemplified by R. Lee et al., “Adaptive Stress Testing of Airborne Collision Avoidance Systems,” DASC 2015.
  - **Summary**
    - The chapter outlines methods for policy evaluation, sampling rare events, and assessing robustness to model errors.
    - Standard error and Bayesian approaches quantify confidence in performance estimates.
    - Importance sampling improves estimation efficiency for rare failure probabilities.
    - Robust and adversarial analyses provide frameworks for stress testing and identifying failure modes.
    - Trade analysis clarifies compromises among multiple objectives in system design.

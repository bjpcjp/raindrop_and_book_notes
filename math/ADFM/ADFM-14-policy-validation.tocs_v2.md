- Policy Validation
  - Performance Metric Evaluation
    The section explains evaluating policies using different performance metrics expressed as expectations over trajectory distributions in Markov decision processes (MDPs). It describes how policy evaluation outputs a state-dependent value function representing expected metric values and how large or continuous state spaces often require sampling for estimation. Key influencing factors include metric definitions, initial state distributions, and computational challenges in estimating rare-event metrics. For additional techniques on risk measures in MDPs, see [Risk-Averse Dynamic Programming for Markov Decision Processes](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10107-009-0307-3).
  - Rare Event Simulation
    This part discusses challenges in estimating metrics influenced by rare events, like collision probabilities, using direct sampling. It introduces importance sampling as an efficient alternative that samples from an alternative proposal distribution and reweights outcomes to provide unbiased estimates. The choice of proposal distribution influences estimator efficiency, and domain expertise guides its design. An extended introduction to rare event simulation is available in [Introduction to Rare Event Simulation](https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9780387009379) by Bucklew.
  - Robustness Analysis
    The section highlights the need to evaluate policy performance under model deviations due to differences between the planning and real-world environments. It recommends stress testing policies in diverse scenarios to assess sensitivity and suggests robust dynamic programming to optimize policies over sets of varying transition and reward models. Factors influencing robustness include model simplicity, fidelity, and computational considerations. Details on robust dynamic programming appear in [Robust Dynamic Programming](https://doi.org/10.1287/moor.1040.0115) by Iyengar.
  - Trade Analysis
    This section covers studying tradeoffs between multiple competing performance metrics, such as safety versus operational efficiency in collision avoidance. It introduces the concept of Pareto optimality, defining policies not dominated by others across all metrics, and the Pareto frontier representing efficient tradeoffs. Varying policy parameters can map the space of achievable tradeoffs, aiding system design choices. Foundational insights on Pareto efficiency are discussed in [Vilfredo Pareto’s Economic Writings](https://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/bios/Pareto.html).
  - Adversarial Analysis
    The section presents adversarial analysis that models an adversary selecting transitions to minimize policy performance while maximizing trajectory likelihood, transforming policy validation into a deterministic search problem. It defines an adversarial reward combining negative original reward with a log-likelihood term weighted by a parameter controlling focus on likely trajectories. The approach helps identify most likely failure trajectories for deeper safety insights. Adaptive stress testing techniques are detailed in [Adaptive Stress Testing of Airborne Collision Avoidance Systems](https://doi.org/10.1109/DASC.2015.7311370).
  - Summary
    The summary recaps key methods for validating policies: performance evaluation via dynamic programming or simulation, confidence assessment using statistical or Bayesian methods, improved rare event estimation through importance sampling, robustness analysis against model uncertainties, tradeoff analysis for multi-objective optimization, and adversarial analysis for safety assessment. It synthesizes the chapter’s analytical tools for real-world deployment readiness.

- **Probability Distributions**
  - **Uniform Distribution**
    - Represents a distribution over the interval (a, b) with constant probability density equal to 1/(b−a).
    - The parameters are the lower bound a and the upper bound b.
    - Relevant for modeling variables equally likely within a specific range.
    - See [Distributions.jl](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.08611) for implementation details.
  - **Gaussian Distribution (Univariate)**
    - Described by mean (µ) and variance (σ²) parameters.
    - Its probability density function is given by the normalized exponential of the squared deviation from the mean.
    - Captures continuous distributions that are symmetric and bell-shaped.
    - Refer to [Distributions.jl](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.08611) for computational tools.
  - **Beta Distribution**
    - Defined on the interval (0, 1) with shape parameters α > 0 and β > 0.
    - Probability density involves Gamma functions and powers of x and (1−x).
    - Models distributions constrained to finite intervals, often used for proportions.
    - Implementation details available in [Distributions.jl](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.08611).
  - **Gaussian Distribution (Multivariate)**
    - Parameterized by mean vector µ and covariance matrix Σ.
    - The density depends on the determinant and inverse of Σ, defining shape and orientation of distribution.
    - Suitable for modeling correlated multivariate continuous data.
    - See example covariance matrices and means in source figures.

  - **Dirichlet Distribution**
    - Concentration parameters α > 0 control the shape of the distribution over vectors on the simplex.
    - Its density function involves Gamma functions and products of powers of components xi.
    - Models probability distributions over proportions summing to one.
    - Visualized for different α parameterizations.

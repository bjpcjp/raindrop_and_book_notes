  - **C.1 Asymptotic Notation**
    - Asymptotic notation characterizes the growth rates of functions and provides upper bounds as the argument approaches a value.
    - The letter O in big-Oh notation stands for the "order" of growth of a function.
    - Constants in functions can be absorbed into the bounding constant in O notation.
    - The order corresponds to the fastest growing term in a linear combination of terms.

  - **C.2 Time Complexity Classes**
    - The class P consists of problems solvable in polynomial time.
    - NP contains problems whose solutions can be verified in polynomial time.
    - NP-hard problems are at least as difficult as the hardest NP problems.
    - NP-complete problems are both NP-hard and belong to NP.
    - The P vs NP problem remains unsolved and is fundamental to cryptography.

  - **C.3 Space Complexity Classes**
    - PSPACE includes problems solvable with polynomial space without time constraints.
    - Time complexity classes P and NP are subsets of PSPACE.
    - Space can be reused during computation, unlike time.
    - PSPACE-hard and PSPACE-complete classes are defined via polynomial time transformations.

  - **C.4 Decideability**
    - Undecidable problems cannot be solved in finite time for all inputs.
    - The halting problem is a canonical example of an undecidable problem.
    - There is no algorithm that can universally determine if arbitrary programs halt.
    - The halting problem applies to languages that are Turing-complete or computationally universal.

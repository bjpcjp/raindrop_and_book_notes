- **Introduction**
  - **Decision Making**
    - An agent acts based on observations of its environment through an observe-act loop.
    - Agents face four main sources of uncertainty: outcome, model, state, and interaction uncertainty.
    - A comprehensive introduction to artificial intelligence is provided by [Russell and Norvig (2021)](https://www.pearson.com/us/higher-education/program/Russell-Artificial-Intelligence-A-Modern-Approach-4th-Edition/PGM333213.html).
  - **Applications**
    - Decision making under uncertainty applies to diverse domains such as aircraft collision avoidance, automated driving, breast cancer screening, financial portfolio allocation, and wildfire surveillance.
    - Challenges include noisy or incomplete observations, unpredictable agent behavior, and balancing risk and reward.
    - Real examples and references in each domain provide foundational resources for deeper study.
  - **Methods**
    - Methods include explicit programming, supervised learning, optimization, planning, and reinforcement learning.
    - Planning uses known models to guide search, whereas reinforcement learning learns strategies from interaction without a known model.
    - Approaches differ in automation level and are chosen based on problem complexity and uncertainty.
  - **History**
    - Decision making automation has roots from ancient myths to modern interdisciplinary research.
    - Major contributions come from economics (utility theory, game theory), psychology (reinforcement learning origins), neuroscience (neural networks), computer science (symbolic and connectionist AI paradigms), engineering (robotics, control theory), mathematics (Bayesian statistics), and operations research (optimization methods).
    - Important foundational works include [Stigler (1950)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1826464), [Koopman (1980)](https://www.elsevier.com/books/search-and-screening/koopman/978-0-08-027099-4), and [Nilsson (2009)](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/quest-artificial-intelligence).
  - **Societal Impact**
    - Decision making algorithms contribute to sustainability, medicine, infrastructure, and transportation.
    - Challenges include algorithmic bias, fairness, adversarial robustness, and ethical responsibility.
    - Relevant surveys analyze AI for social good such as [Shi et al. (2020)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.01818).
  - **Overview**
    - The book is structured into five parts addressing probabilistic reasoning, sequential decision problems, model uncertainty (reinforcement learning), state uncertainty (POMDPs), and multiagent systems.
    - Each part builds on the previous to address increasingly complex uncertainty and interaction scenarios.
    - Fundamental models such as Markov decision processes (MDP), partially observable MDPs, and Markov games are introduced with solution methods.

- **8 First-Order Logic**
  - **8.1 Representation Revisited**
    - Knowledge representation languages need to be declarative, compositional, expressive, context independent, and unambiguous.
    - Programming languages lack domain-independent inference mechanisms unlike propositional logic.
    - Natural languages are expressive but have issues with ambiguity and context dependence.
    - The Sapir–Whorf hypothesis states language influences thought with various empirical studies discussed.

  - **8.2 Syntax and Semantics of First-Order Logic**
    - Models include a nonempty domain of objects and an interpretation mapping symbols to objects, relations, and functions.
    - Syntax involves constant, predicate, and function symbols with arity, plus terms, atomic and complex sentences.
    - Quantifiers ∀ and ∃ allow expressing properties over all or some objects, with connected semantics.
    - Equality is treated as a built-in predicate to assert identity between objects.
    - An alternative database semantics uses the unique-names and closed-world assumptions.

  - **8.3 Using First-Order Logic**
    - The TELL/ASK interface allows adding assertions and querying knowledge bases, with variable bindings from queries.
    - The kinship domain vocabulary includes predicates for family relations and functions for Mother and Father.
    - Numbers are defined recursively using Peano axioms with successor functions and addition axioms.
    - Set theory axioms define sets, membership, unions, intersections, and equality.
    - The wumpus world is concisely represented using quantified axioms for adjacency and percepts, improving over propositional logic.

  - **8.4 Knowledge Engineering in First-Order Logic**
    - The knowledge-engineering process includes task identification, knowledge acquisition, vocabulary selection, encoding axioms, encoding problem instances, posing queries, and debugging.
    - An extended example in electronic circuits illustrates ontology design with gates, terminals, connections, signals, and axioms modeling their behaviors.
    - Queries enable verification of circuit functionality and debugging via logical inference.
    - The process emphasizes iterative refinement of vocabulary and axioms for correctness.

  - **8.5 Summary**
    - First-order logic is more expressive than propositional logic due to ontological commitments to objects and relations.
    - Its syntax builds on propositional logic by adding terms and quantifiers to represent and reason about objects.
    - Models include objects and interpretations linking symbols to domain elements.
    - Knowledge base development requires analysis, vocabulary design, and axiom encoding for effective reasoning.

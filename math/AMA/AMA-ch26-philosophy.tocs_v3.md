- **Philosophical Foundations**
  - **Weak AI: Can Machines Act Intelligently?**
    - Weak AI hypothesis asserts machines can simulate intelligent behavior, founded at the 1956 AI workshop.
    - Philosophers debate whether machines truly think, with objections including the qualification problem and mathematical limits.
    - The Turing Test evaluates machine intelligence based on conversational behavior, but passing it remains unachieved by sophisticated judges.
    - [Turing’s Original Paper](https://www.csee.umbc.edu/courses/471/papers/turing.pdf)
  - **Arguments Against Strong AI**
    - Argument from disability claims machines cannot perform many human behaviors such as kindness, humor, or love.
    - Mathematical objections reference Gödel’s incompleteness theorem to argue machines are limited compared to humans.
    - The qualification problem states human behavior is too complex to be fully encapsulated by rule-based machines.

  - **Embodied Cognition**
    - Cognition depends on the agent being embodied and embedded in an environment, involving sensory and motor integration.
    - Biological brains function as control systems for physical bodies interacting in real-world settings.
    - Embodied cognition integrates robotics and perception as central, not peripheral, to understanding intelligence.

- **Strong AI: Can Machines Really Think?**
  - **Turing’s Argument from Consciousness**
    - Objections to machines thinking focus on consciousness, awareness, and intentionality.
    - Turing proposes a pragmatic “polite convention” to attribute thinking and consciousness based on demonstrated behavior.
    - Examples show conversational tests where machines simulate understanding but raise questions about genuine awareness.

  - **Mind–Body Problem**
    - Dualism posits mind and body as separate substances, creating interaction challenges.
    - Physicalism identifies minds with physical brain states, allowing for strong AI in principle.
    - Mental states are considered as intentional states that relate to brain states and environmental history (wide vs. narrow content).
    - [Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy: Mind–Body Problem](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/mind-body/)
  - **Functionalism and the Brain Replacement Experiment**
    - Functionalism defines mental states by their causal role and functional isomorphism between systems.
    - Brain replacement thought experiment tests whether gradual neuron replacement by electronic devices preserves consciousness.
    - Three conclusions include consciousness preservation, epiphenomenal consciousness, or experiment impossibility.
    - [Philosophy of Mind: Functionalism](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/functionalim/)
  - **Biological Naturalism and the Chinese Room**
    - Biological naturalism claims mental states arise from specific causal powers of neurons, not merely program execution.
    - Searle’s Chinese Room argues that syntactic symbol manipulation alone cannot produce understanding or minds.
    - The systems reply highlights that understanding may reside in the whole system, provoking debate.
    - [Searle’s Chinese Room Argument](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/chinese-room/)
  - **Consciousness, Qualia, and the Explanatory Gap**
    - Consciousness involves subjective experience or qualia, which challenge functionalist accounts.
    - The explanatory gap highlights the difficulty relating physical brain states to subjective experience.
    - The inverted spectrum thought experiment illustrates qualia’s possible variation independent of external behavior.

- **The Ethics and Risks of Developing Artificial Intelligence**
  - **Job Displacement and Economic Impact**
    - AI has replaced some jobs but also created new ones, shifting from replacement expert systems to assistant agents.
    - Automation affects labor markets by introducing higher-paying and more interesting jobs while also raising unemployment concerns.
    - [AI and the Future of Work](https://www.brookings.edu/research/automation-and-artificial-intelligence-how-machines-affect-people-and-places/)
  - **Leisure Time and Work Pressure**
    - Predictions of shorter workweeks have not materialized; instead, information economy pressures increase work hours.
    - High-bandwidth communication and intellectual property replication reward working harder to outperform competitors.
    - AI contributes to innovation pace but also offers potential for automation to reduce human workload.

  - **Human Uniqueness and Moral Concerns**
    - AI challenges human uniqueness in moral and philosophical terms, comparable to historical paradigm shifts in worldview.
    - Concerns include the psychological and societal impact of AI eroding perceived human specialness.
    - [Weizenbaum’s Critique of AI](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/computer-power-and-human-reason)
  - **AI Misuse and Surveillance**
    - AI technologies can be exploited for warfare, repression, and mass surveillance, as demonstrated by battlefield and civic systems.
    - Privacy trade-offs and civil liberties issues arise from ubiquitous AI-enabled monitoring.
    - Approaches to balance privacy and security include transparency and reciprocal surveillance accessibility.
    - [Ethics of AI and Surveillance](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ethics-ai/)
  - **Accountability and Liability**
    - Legal questions arise about responsibility for actions when AI systems assist or replace human decision-makers.
    - Courts currently treat expert systems like reference tools, placing responsibility on human operators.
    - Increasing autonomy of AI raises concerns about establishing legal personhood and transactional liabilities.

  - **Ultraintelligent Machines and Singularity**
    - Ultraintelligent machines are defined as entities surpassing human intellect, potentially leading to an intelligence explosion.
    - The technological singularity is a hypothesized rapid growth point after which human intelligence is surpassed.
    - Challenges include limits of computability, impact on society, and ensuring AI friendliness and safety.

  - **Asimov’s Laws and Friendly AI**
    - Asimov’s three laws of robotics aim to ensure safety and obedience to humans but raise issues in practical implementation.
    - Designing AI with adaptable, evolving utility functions requires mechanisms to maintain friendliness and prevent harmful behavior.
    - Historical and fictional examples illustrate the importance of safeguards and ethical constraints in AI development.

- **B.1 Defining Languages with Backus–Naur Form (BNF)**
  - A formal language is a set of strings formed from sequences of symbols and characterized concisely by a grammar.
  - Context-free grammars are used, where expressions have the same form in any context, and are written using BNF.
  - BNF grammars consist of terminal symbols, nonterminal symbols, a start symbol, and rewrite rules of the form LHS → RHS.
  - Rewrite rules define how nonterminal symbols can be expanded into sequences of terminals or other nonterminals.

- **B.2 Describing Algorithms with Pseudocode**
  - The book uses pseudocode resembling languages like Java, C++, or Lisp for algorithm descriptions.
  - Special features include persistent variables, function values, significant indentation, destructuring assignment, generator functions, list and set notation, and 1-based array indices.
  - Persistent variables maintain their values across function calls but are scoped locally to their function.
  - Generator functions yield values one at a time, enabling iteration over potentially infinite sets.

- **B.3 Online Help**
  - Implementations of the book's algorithms are available in Java, Lisp, and Python at the online code repository aima.cs.berkeley.edu.
  - The website provides instructions for submitting comments, corrections, suggestions, and joining discussion lists.
  - This resource supports practical application and further engagement with the book's materials.

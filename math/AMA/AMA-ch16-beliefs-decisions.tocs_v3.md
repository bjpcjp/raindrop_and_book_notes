- **Making Simple Decisions**
  - **16.1 Combining Beliefs and Desires Under Uncertainty**
    - Defines resulting states of actions as random variables due to nondeterministic environments.
    - Formulates expected utility as the sum over possible outcomes weighted by their probabilities.
    - Presents the principle of maximum expected utility (MEU) as the rational decision rule.
    - Explains that computing expected utilities requires perception, learning, causal models, and planning.
    - References Bayesian networks for probabilistic inference, e.g., [Bayesian Networks and Decision Making](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_network).
  - **16.2 The Basis of Utility Theory**
    - Introduces axioms of rational preferences: orderability, transitivity, continuity, substitutability, monotonicity, and decomposability.
    - Shows these axioms imply the existence of a utility function consistent with preferences.
    - Establishes that utilities are unique only up to positive affine transformations.
    - Clarifies that expected utility of lotteries is the probability-weighted sum of outcome utilities.
    - Recommends foundational texts like [von Neumann and Morgenstern (1944)](https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691010997/theory-of-games-and-economic-behavior).
  - **16.3 Utility Functions**
    - Notes utility functions can be arbitrarily complex but real agent preferences tend to be systematic.
    - Discusses preference elicitation techniques to assess utilities using standard lotteries.
    - Introduces normalized utilities scaling best and worst outcomes to 1 and 0.
    - Presents the micromort and QALY (quality-adjusted life year) as utility measurement units.
    - Analyzes utility of money, emphasizing typically concave utility functions reflecting risk aversion.
    - Defines risk-averse, risk-seeking, and risk-neutral behaviors based on utility curvature.
    - Describes the optimizer’s curse, where selecting an action with maximum estimated utility leads to overoptimism.
    - Explains decision theory as normative, contrasting observed human irrationalities like the Allais and Ellsberg paradoxes.
    - Highlights concepts such as certainty effect, ambiguity aversion, framing effect, anchoring effect, and evolutionary psychology perspectives.
    - Refers to [Kahneman and Tversky (1979)](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.187.4157.1068) for experimental evidence on irrationality.
  - **16.4 Multiattribute Utility Functions**
    - Deals with decision problems involving multiple attributes per outcome.
    - Defines strict dominance and stochastic dominance for deterministic and uncertain cases respectively.
    - Stochastic dominance requires cumulative distribution of one action to be everywhere better than another.
    - Introduces preference independence and mutual preferential independence (MPI) among attributes.
    - Shows MPI implies additive value functions, simplifying utility specification.
    - Defines utility independence extending preference independence to lotteries.
    - Introduces mutually utility independent (MUI) attributes leading to multiplicative utility functions.

  - **16.5 Decision Networks**
    - Introduces decision networks combining chance nodes, decision nodes, and utility nodes.
    - Describes structure and graphical modeling for decisions with probabilistic outcomes and utilities.
    - Shows simplified decision networks with direct action-utility functions as compiled forms.
    - Details evaluation algorithm: set evidence, explore decision node values, compute posterior probabilities, calculate expected utilities, and select optimal action.
    - Connects decision networks to Bayesian network inference for rational decision-making.
    - Points to [Howard and Matheson (1984)](https://ai.stanford.edu/~yekutiel/papers/InfluenceDiagramTutorial.pdf) for foundational influence diagrams.
  - **16.6 The Value of Information**
    - Defines value of perfect information (VPI) as the expected utility improvement from learning exact outcome of a variable.
    - Presents a general formula for VPI based on averaging over evidence outcomes.
    - Explains intuition: information is valuable when likely to change the plan and the new plan improves expected utility.
    - Proves VPI is always nonnegative and order independent but not additive.
    - Describes myopic information-gathering agents selecting observations with maximal value per cost.
    - Notes myopic agents may fail to recognize benefits of sequential observations but perform well in practice.
    - Suggests using decision networks and VPI for efficient question ordering and stopping criteria in expert systems.
    - Recommends [Ron Howard’s works on information value](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0024630170900281) for deeper understanding.
  - **16.7 Decision-Theoretic Expert Systems**
    - Describes decision analysis as applied decision theory to high-stakes domains like medicine and engineering.
    - Explains earlier expert systems focused on inference, while decision-theoretic systems incorporate utilities to recommend optimal actions.
    - Highlights the pitfall of confusing likelihood and importance, countered by utility-based approaches.
    - Presents a knowledge engineering process: create causal models, simplify, assign probabilities and utilities, verify, and perform sensitivity analysis.
    - Gives an example of a medical expert system for aortic coarctation, illustrating model building and refinement.
    - Emphasizes sensitivity analysis to assess robustness and prioritize data collection.

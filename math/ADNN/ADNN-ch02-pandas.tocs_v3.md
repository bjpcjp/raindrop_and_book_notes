- **Chapter 2**
  - **2.1 Part 2.1: Introduction to Pandas**
    - Pandas provides high-performance data structures and analysis tools based on the dataframe concept from R.
    - The Auto MPG dataset from the UCI repository is used to demonstrate loading, displaying, and manipulating dataframes.
    - Methods such as replacing missing values, removing outliers, dropping fields, concatenating rows/columns, and splitting datasets are covered.
    - Saving dataframes in CSV and Pickle formats is illustrated for portability and precision.

  - **2.2 Part 2.2: Categorical and Continuous Values**
    - Data for neural networks must be numeric and typically encoded through normalization or one-hot encoding.
    - Four data types are outlined: nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio; each affects encoding approaches.
    - Encoding techniques include z-score normalization for continuous data and dummy (one-hot) variables for categorical data.
    - Target encoding and ordinal encoding offer alternative categorical encoding methods, with risks like overfitting.

  - **2.3 Part 2.3: Grouping, Sorting, and Shuffling**
    - Grouping (similar to SQL GROUP BY) summarizes data by aggregating fields such as mean or count.
    - Shuffling data is essential to prevent order bias in training and validation splitting.
    - Sorting enables ordering data by one or more columns for inspection or preprocessing.
    - Original data must be preserved before grouping to avoid information loss.

  - **2.4 Part 2.4: Apply and Map**
    - The map function transforms values in a single column based on mappings, such as converting numeric codes to descriptive names.
    - The apply function runs a custom or lambda function across rows or columns for flexible feature calculations.
    - A practical example uses IRS tax data to estimate average adjusted gross income by zipcode, combining grouping and weighted averages.
    - Functional programming with apply and map facilitates complex feature engineering operations on dataframes.

  - **2.5 Part 2.5: Feature Engineering**
    - Feature engineering can add calculated columns derived from existing data, e.g., converting weight from pounds to kilograms.
    - External APIs like Google Maps can enrich data, exemplified by geocoding addresses to obtain latitude and longitude.
    - Calculating distances between geographic points aids encoding locations as features for neural networks.
    - Example given calculates distances from Washington University to other universities using the great circle distance formula.

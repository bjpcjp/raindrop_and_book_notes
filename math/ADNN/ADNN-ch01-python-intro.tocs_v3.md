- **0.1 Introduction**
  - Deep learning is a set of technologies enabling neural networks to handle tabular data, images, text, and audio.
  - It mimics human brain function by learning hierarchies of information.
  - The course covers classic neural networks, CNN, LSTM, GRU, GAN, reinforcement learning, and HPC on GPUs and grids.
  - Implementation is in Python using TensorFlow and Keras, with no prior Python experience required.
  - Use [Deep Learning Course Overview](https://example.org) for extended learning.

- **Chapter 1 Python Preliminaries**
  - **1.1 Part 1.1: Course Overview**
    - Introduces advanced neural network types including deep belief networks, CNNs, and recurrent networks.
    - Covers HPC for deep learning on GPUs and grids.
    - Assignments include 10 individual modules, Kaggle group project, and final team project.
    - The instructor is Jeff Heaton, with significant research and industry credentials.
    - Resources include Google CoLab, Anaconda, Jupyter Notebooks, TensorFlow, and Kaggle.
    - [Jeff Heaton's homepage](https://www.heatonresearch.com) is relevant for more info.
  
  - **1.2 Part 1.2: Introduction to Python**
    - Python 3 is emphasized as the language for this course and deep learning implementation.
    - Covers basics including printing, comments, variables, data types, conditionals, loops, and f-strings.
    - Highlights the difference between Python 2 and Python 3 syntax.
    - Introduces the significance of whitespace (indents) for code blocks.
    - Suggests further reading in Python [Official Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/).
  
  - **1.3 Part 1.3: Python Lists, Dictionaries, Sets and JSON**
    - Explains Python's fundamental mutable and immutable collections: lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries.
    - Lists are ordered and mutable, tuples are ordered and immutable, sets are unordered and disallow duplicates.
    - Dictionaries store key-value pairs with examples of nested lists and dictionaries.
    - Introduces JSON as hierarchical data format compatible with Python dictionaries and lists.
    - Demonstrates loading and saving JSON and retrieving JSON from URLs.
    - See [JSON official site](https://www.json.org/json-en.html) for more details.
  
  - **1.4 Part 1.4: File Handling**
    - Details reading data from local files, internet URLs, and cloud storage like Google Drive.
    - Describes reading CSV files via pandas and streaming large CSV files line-by-line for memory efficiency.
    - Covers reading text files line-by-line and loading images via Python PIL package.
    - Highlights relevance for AI practice including data input and model persistence.
    - Refer to [Pandas Documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/) for CSV handling.
  
  - **1.5 Part 1.5: Functions, Lambdas, and Map/Reduce**
    - Introduces function definitions with default and named parameters, incremental code reuse.
    - Demonstrates Python's map for list transformation, filter for conditional subsetting, lambda expressions as anonymous functions.
    - Explains reduce for aggregating list elements into a single value, such as summation.
    - Emphasizes functional programming techniques relevant for data processing in AI.

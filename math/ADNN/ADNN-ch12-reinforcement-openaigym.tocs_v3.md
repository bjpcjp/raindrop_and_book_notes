- **12.1 Part 12.1: Introduction to the OpenAI Gym**
  - OpenAI Gym provides a standardized benchmark with diverse environments for AI research, aiming at reproducibility.
  - It currently supports Python and has platform-specific limitations, including Linux, Mac, and partial Windows compatibility.
  - Key components include action space, observation space, agent, step, episode, render, reward, and nondeterminism.
  - The leaderboard is informal, based on an honor system, with scoring performed locally and reproducibility documentation required.
  - For more details, see the [OpenAI Gym GitHub repository](https://github.com/openai/gym).

- **12.1.1 OpenAI Gym Leaderboard**
  - The leaderboard records local scoring submitted by users under an honor code.
  - Submissions must include reproduction instructions and optionally a video.
  - The leaderboard is maintained on a GitHub repository.

- **12.1.2 Looking at Gym Environments**
  - Environments define games or simulations with discrete or continuous action and observation spaces.
  - Examples include MountainCar-v0, CartPole-v1, MountainCarContinuous-v0, and Breakout environments with various action and observation specifications.
  - Nondeterminism means an environment behaves randomly even with a seeded random generator.
  - Querying environment attributes allows inspection of properties like action space and reward thresholds.

- **12.2 Part 12.2: Introduction to Q-Learning**
  - Q-Learning is a foundational reinforcement learning algorithm that uses a Q-table to map states to action rewards.
  - It handles continuous states by discretization (binning) and primarily supports discrete actions.
  - The Mountain Car environment illustrates the Q-Learning problem and solution approach.
  - Key Q-Learning parameters include learning rate (alpha), discount factor (lambda), epsilon for exploration, and bin sizes for state discretization.
  - The Q-Learning update equation balances old Q-values with new reward and future estimated rewards.

- **12.2.1 Introducing the Mountain Car**
  - The Mountain Car problem requires using potential energy to escape a valley with insufficient engine power.
  - The environment has three discrete actions (left force, no force, right force) and two continuous state variables (position and velocity).
  - Rendering can be done with TF-Agents, showing state and reward over time for a fixed action.

- **12.2.2 Programmed Car**
  - A hand-programmed agent applies force based on the car's velocity direction.
  - This simple agent solves the problem by switching directions when velocity changes sign.
  - The output demonstrates agent performance and state progression over steps.

- **12.2.3 Reinforcement Learning**
  - Q-Learning learns by updating Q-values based on observed rewards and maximizing expected future rewards.
  - The epsilon parameter controls the balance between exploration and exploitation.
  - The temporal difference update calculates changes by comparing new reward plus discounted future rewards against old Q-values.
  - Hyperparameters have notable influence and include learning rate, discount, epsilon decay schedule, and discretization grid size.

  - Patterns emerge in the Q-table action selection correlating with position and velocity bins.

- **12.3 Part 12.3: Keras Q-Learning in the OpenAI Gym**
  - Traditional Q-Learning struggles with large state spaces due to the exponentially growing Q-table.
  - Deep Q-Learning Networks (DQN) use neural networks to approximate Q-values, generalizing across states.
  - DQNs map environment states to expected rewards for each discrete action, suitable for environments like CartPole.
  - TF-Agents provides modular components to implement DQNs: environment, agent, policies, metrics, replay buffer, data collection, and training.

- **14. COMBINATORIAL PROBLEMS**
  - **14.6 Generating Partitions**
    - Describes two main types of partitions: integer partitions and set partitions, which are fundamentally different combinatorial objects.
    - Integer partitions are multisets of positive integers summing to n, with examples and applications such as nuclear fission simulation.
    - Set partitions divide the set {1, ..., n} into nonempty subsets, illustrated with all 15 partitions of n=4.
    - Presents algorithms for generating integer partitions in lexicographic decreasing order and for generating random partitions using recurrences and probabilities.
    - Explains encoding set partitions as restricted growth functions and generating them in lexicographic order using Stirling numbers of the second kind.
    - References include implementations by Kreher and Stinson, combinatorial servers, Nijenhuis and Wilf, Combinatorica, and foundational texts by Knuth and Andrews.
  - **Notes**
    - Knuth [Knu05b] is the primary source for algorithms on integer and set partitions.
    - Highlights the equivalence between integer partitions and distinct set partitions of multisets.
    - Discusses related combinatorial objects such as Young tableaux and integer compositions.
    - Mentions the application of compositions for distributing indistinguishable balls into distinguishable boxes.
    - Suggests related topics like permutation and subset generation addressed elsewhere in the text.

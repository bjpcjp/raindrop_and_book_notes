- **Point Location Problem**
  - **Input and Problem Description**
    - Input consists of a planar decomposition into polygonal regions and a query point q.
    - The problem is to determine which polygonal region contains the query point.
    - Point location is fundamental in computational geometry with practical applications like police dispatch systems.
  - **Variations of Point Location**
    - The simplest version tests if a point is inside or outside a polygon using ray casting and edge intersection counts.
    - Testing each polygon edge for intersection takes O(n) time; convex polygons allow O(log n) binary search methods.
    - Performing point location separately for each region is inefficient; constructing advanced data structures speeds up queries.
    - Triangulating regions simplifies inside-outside tests to point-in-triangle checks.
    - Grid-like or tree-like data structures enhance efficiency by localizing search regions.
    - Regularly sized regions allow the use of grid files; irregular subdivisions may require kd-trees.
    - Higher dimensional point location favors kd-tree structures.
  - **Point Location Techniques**
    - Walking: starting from a known cell near the query point and moving stepwise toward q via ray shooting.
    - Slab Method: partitions space with horizontal lines to form slabs, uses binary search on y-coordinates with O(n²) worst-case space.
    - Hierarchies of triangulations provide O(log n) query time with linear space by building triangle hierarchies.
    - kd-Trees split space into hierarchical boxes, enabling efficient search especially with irregular subdivisions.
  - **Implementation and Libraries**
    - CGAL supports planar subdivisions with both jump-and-walk and worst-case logarithmic search.
    - LEDA provides expected O(log n) point location using partially persistent search trees.
    - ANN library supports nearest neighbor searching and can assist in starting walking queries.
    - Arrange is a C library supporting polygon arrangements and randomized incremental construction for efficient point location.
    - Simple point-in-polygon tests are available in C routines by O’Rourke and Sutherland-Reeves.

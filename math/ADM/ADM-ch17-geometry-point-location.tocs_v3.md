- **Point Location**
  - **Input and Problem Description**
    - Input consists of a decomposition of the plane into polygonal regions and a query point q.
    - The problem is to identify which region contains the query point.
    - Point location is essential for applications like police dispatch systems to find precincts or districts.
  - **Variations of Point Location**
    - Inside-outside test for a polygon uses ray casting and counting edge crossings to determine point containment.
    - Testing complexity is O(n) for general polygons and O(log n) for convex polygons using binary search.
    - Triangulation reduces polygon point-in-test to a point-in-triangle test, improving efficiency.
  - **Data Structures and Methods**
    - Grid files use k × k grids overlaying subdivisions to limit search regions and improve query speed.
    - Slab method creates horizontal slabs to facilitate binary searches for point location but costs O(n²) space.
    - Kd-trees decompose space hierarchically for efficient point location in higher dimensions or irregular subdivisions.
    - Walking method navigates from a known cell to the query cell via ray shooting queries with expected O(n^(1/d)) path length.
  - **Algorithmic Trade-offs**
    - Worst-case efficient algorithms require either substantial storage or more complex implementation.
    - Kd-trees are recommended for general-purpose point-location applications for their balance of efficiency and ease of use.
  - **Implementations and Libraries**
    - CGAL supports jump-and-walk and worst-case logarithmic point location searches.
    - LEDA offers expected O(log n) point location using partially persistent search trees.
    - ANN library assists in nearest-neighbor searches to find nearby cell boundaries.
    - Arrange manages polygon arrangements and supports efficient point location on arrangements.
  - **Further Notes and References**
    - Snoeyink provides a comprehensive survey of point location methods.
    - The triangle refinement method by Kirkpatrick achieves linear space and O(log n) query time using triangulation hierarchies.
    - Slab and alternative hierarchical triangulation methods have theoretical grounding in [DL76], [PS85], [EGS86], and others.
    - Dynamic data structures support incremental changes to planar subdivisions with maintained query efficiency.
    - For more details, reference works include [Sno04], [CT92], and various algorithm engineering studies such as [TV01].

- **Graph Partition**
  - **Input Description**
    - The input consists of a weighted graph \( G = (V, E) \) and integers \( k \) and \( m \).
    - The goal is to partition the vertices into \( m \) roughly equal-sized subsets.
    - The total edge cost spanning the subsets should not exceed \( k \).
  - **Problem Description and Applications**
    - Graph partitioning is essential for divide-and-conquer algorithms to break problems into equal-sized pieces.
    - Minimizing edges cut in partitions simplifies merging solutions.
    - It aids clustering by grouping “similar” vertices and improves data locality and visualization.
    - Critical in parallel algorithms, such as finite element methods, to minimize interface size between partitions.
  - **Flavors of Graph Partitioning**
    - Minimum cut set: smallest edge set disconnecting the graph, efficiently found by network flow or randomized algorithms; may produce unbalanced partitions.
    - Balanced graph partition: partitions vertices into roughly equal pieces with a small cut; this problem is NP-complete but heuristics work well.
    - Maximum cut: finds the edge cut with maximum total weight, used in circuit communication modeling; also NP-complete.
    - Special graphs like trees and planar graphs have known small separators, useful for decomposition.
  - **Basic Approaches and Heuristics**
    - Initial partitions are constructed randomly or using problem-specific strategies.
    - Iterative improvement moves vertices to reduce cut size, evaluated by neighbors’ partition.
    - Process may require multiple iterations due to dependencies on neighbors’ moves.
    - Randomization techniques, especially simulated annealing, improve outcomes.
    - Recursive application handles more than two partitions.
  - **Spectral Partitioning Methods**
    - Use linear algebra and the graph Laplacian’s eigenvectors for initial bi-partition.
    - Spectral methods identify general partition areas effectively.
    - Local optimization methods can refine spectral partitions.
  - **Implementations**
    - Chaco: widely used for parallel computing graph partitioning; implements Kernighan-Lin and spectral methods; [Chaco](http://www.cs.sandia.gov/~bahendr/chaco.html).
    - METIS: efficient for large graphs, supports parallel and hypergraph partitioning; [METIS](http://glaros.dtc.umn.edu/gkhome/views/metis).
    - Other notable tools include Scotch and JOSTLE.

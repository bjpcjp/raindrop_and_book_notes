- **12.3 Suffix Trees and Arrays**
  - **Input and Problem Description**
    - The input is a reference string S and the problem is to build a data structure for quickly finding all occurrences of an arbitrary query string q in S.
    - Suffix trees and arrays are efficient data structures for substring searches.
    - Refer to the discussion of suffix trees and arrays for more details on their usage and construction.
  - **Suffix Trees**
    - A suffix tree is a trie of all proper suffixes of a string S.
    - It enables substring testing in linear time relative to the length of the query string q.
    - Naive trie-based suffix trees require O(n²) time and space, but linear-space collapsed suffix trees store edges as substring indices.
    - Linear-time algorithms exist for constructing collapsed suffix trees using clever pointer structures.
    - Applications include finding all occurrences of q, longest common substrings among strings, and finding the longest palindrome in S.
    - For deeper study see Gusfield [Gus97] and Crochemore and Rytter [CR03].
  - **Suffix Arrays**
    - A suffix array is a sorted array of all suffixes of S represented by their starting positions.
    - Searching for a substring q can be done by binary search in O(log n) comparisons plus |q| character checks.
    - Suffix arrays require roughly four times less memory than suffix trees and are easier to implement.
    - Efficient suffix array construction algorithms exist, some building from suffix trees; recent algorithms achieve linear time.
    - A comprehensive survey of suffix array algorithms and implementations is available at [PST07].
  - **Implementations**
    - Numerous suffix array and tree implementations exist in C/C++ and Java.
    - Notable resources include Schürmann and Stoye’s C implementation [SS07], Pizza&Chili corpus compressed indexes, BioJava’s SuffixTree class, and libstree implementing Ukkonen’s algorithm.
    - Additional code collections include Nelson’s C++ suffix tree code and Strmat exact pattern matching tools by Gusfield.
  - **Notes and Related Work**
    - Tries were introduced by Fredkin [Fre62], derived from the word “retrieval.”
    - Suffix tree construction algorithms were developed by Weiner, McCreight, and Ukkonen.
    - Suffix arrays were introduced by Manber and Myers, related to Pat trees by Gonnet and Baeza-Yates.
    - Linear-time suffix array algorithms emerged in 2003 from multiple teams [KSPP03, KA03, KSB05].
    - Recent work includes compressed full-text indexes with near-entropy size and efficient query times [MN07].
    - Least common ancestor (LCA) data structures enable constant-time queries on suffix trees and are foundational for related algorithms.
    - Further readings include Gusfield’s book [Gus97] and Crochemore and Rytter [CR03].
  - **Related Problems**
    - Suffix trees and arrays relate to string matching, text compression, and longest common substring problems, referenced on pages 628, 637, and 650 respectively.

- **Preface**
  - The book stresses the importance of algorithm design techniques and resources for practical computer science.
  - Three key features highlighted are a catalog of algorithmic problems, war stories illustrating real-world applications, and electronic resources for implementations.
  - Emphasis is placed on design over formal mathematical analysis.
  - The book is intended for students and professionals, suitable for traditional and active learning courses.
  - Further reading includes [The Algorithm Design Manual website](http://www.cs.sunysb.edu/~algorith) and Cormen et al. [CLRS01].

- **I Practical Algorithm Design**
  - **1 Introduction to Algorithm Design**
    - Defines algorithms in terms of problem instances and solutions, emphasizing correctness and implementation ease.
    - Presents practical examples such as robot tour optimization (Traveling Salesman Problem) and movie scheduling.
    - Explains the difference between heuristics and guaranteed algorithms.
    - Discusses techniques to reason about correctness, including proofs, counterexamples, induction, and recursive structures.
    - Highlights the critical role of modeling problems using common combinatorial objects like permutations, subsets, graphs, trees, and strings.
    - War stories illustrate real applications of algorithm design principles.
    - Further reading: Bentley’s Programming Pearls [Ben90], Gries [Gri89].
  
  - **2 Algorithm Analysis**
    - Introduces the RAM model as a machine-independent model for analyzing algorithms.
    - Defines best-case, worst-case, and average-case complexities.
    - Presents the Big Oh notation as a tool to express asymptotic upper bounds on algorithm running times, emphasizing worst-case for robustness.
    - Formalizes Big Oh, Omega, and Theta notation with constants and threshold values.
    - Provides examples and clarifies the meaning and use of Big Oh notation.
    - Further reading: [Introduction to Algorithms](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/introduction-algorithms) by Cormen et al.

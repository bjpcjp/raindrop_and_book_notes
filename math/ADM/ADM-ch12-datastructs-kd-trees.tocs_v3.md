- **Kd-Trees**
  - **Input and Problem Description**
    - The input is a set S of n points or geometric objects in k dimensions.
    - The problem is constructing a tree that partitions space by half-planes so each object occupies a unique box-shaped region.
    - Kd-trees hierarchically decompose space into cells containing few points to enable fast positional access.
  - **Kd-Tree Construction and Partitioning**
    - Each node is defined by a plane cutting through one dimension, ideally splitting points evenly.
    - Partitioning cycles through dimensions or selects the largest dimension to create balanced, fat cells.
    - The space is divided into box-shaped regions defined by 2k half-planes along any root-to-node path.
  - **Variations of Kd-Trees**
    - Cycling Dimensions: iteratively partition on dimensions d1 to dk before repeating.
    - Largest Dimension Cut: partitions on the dimension maximizing region “fatness”.
    - Quadtrees/Octtrees: use axis-aligned planes through partition points, producing multiple children per node.
    - BSP-Trees: use general cutting planes producing polyhedral cells for complex objects.
    - R-Trees: partition with possibly overlapping boxes for objects that cannot be axis-aligned partitioned.
  - **Applications of Kd-Trees**
    - Point Location: query point location by traversing from root to leaf cell based on partition planes.
    - Nearest Neighbor Search: locate closest point by searching neighbor cells within distance of candidate points.
    - Range Search: find points inside a query region by pruning branches whose cells do not intersect the region.
    - Partial Key Search: search on incomplete point information by recursively exploring uncertain dimensions.
  - **Limitations and Dimensionality Effects**
    - Kd-trees work best in low to moderate dimensions (up to ~20).
    - Performance degrades with high dimensions due to exponential growth of neighbors and cell complexity.
    - Dimensionality reduction techniques, such as random projections, help maintain efficiency.
  - **Implementations and Resources**
    - Implementations include KDTREE 2 (C++/Fortran), Samet’s Java demos, Terralib GIS library, and DIMACS challenge codes.
    - Samet [Sam06] is a comprehensive reference on kd-trees with variants and detailed explanation.
    - Bentley [Ben75] is credited with developing kd-trees.

- **Discrete Fourier Transform**
  - **Input description**
    - The input is a sequence of n real or complex values \( h_i \), with indices \( 0 \le i \le n-1 \).
    - Samples are taken at uniform intervals from a function \( h \).
  - **Problem description**
    - The discrete Fourier transform is defined as \( H_m = \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} h_k e^{-2\pi i k m / n} \) for \( 0 \le m \le n-1 \).
    - It transforms a time series into the frequency domain.
  - **Discussion**
    - Fourier transforms convert time-domain samples into frequency-domain representations, making certain operations easier.
    - Applications include filtering noise, image compression, convolution, deconvolution, and computing correlations.
    - For example, filtering involves removing frequency components and applying the inverse transform to denoise data.
    - Fourier transforms efficiently compute convolutions, reducing complexity from \( O(n^2) \) to \( O(n \log n) \) using FFT.
  - **Definition and inverse transform**
    - The discrete Fourier transform outputs n complex numbers each representing sine function components of given frequencies.
    - The inverse transform is \( h_m = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} H_k e^{2\pi i k m / n} \), allowing conversion back to time domain.
  - **Computational aspects and FFT**
    - Computing the discrete Fourier transform directly takes \( O(n^2) \) time.
    - The fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithm reduces this to \( O(n \log n) \).
    - FFT uses a divide-and-conquer approach, recursively splitting the problem into transforms on \( n/2 \) points.
    - The FFT typically requires \( n \) to be a power of two; zero-padding is recommended otherwise.
    - FFTs are often implemented in optimized hardware or tuned assembly language to meet real-time constraints.
  - **Implementations**
    - FFTW is a widely used C library supporting arbitrary input sizes and both real and complex data, known for speed and awarded the 1999 J. H. Wilkinson Prize.
    - FFTPACK is a Fortran package for fast Fourier transforms including complex, real, sine, and cosine transforms, available on Netlib.
    - The GNU Scientific Library provides a reimplementation of FFTPACK for C/C++.
    - Algorithm 545 is a Fortran FFT implementation optimized for virtual memory performance.

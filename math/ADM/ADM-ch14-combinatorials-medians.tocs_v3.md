- **14.3 Median and Selection**
  - **Input and Problem Description**
    - The input consists of a set of n numbers or keys and an integer k.
    - The problem is to find the key smaller than exactly k of the n keys.
    - Median finding is a specific case of the selection problem, which finds the kth element in sorted order.
  - **Applications of Selection**
    - Selection helps filter outlying elements by identifying percentile boundaries for noisy data.
    - It enables identifying top candidates in scenarios such as computer chess move evaluation.
    - Selection is used to compute deciles and other regular intervals for data distribution analysis.
    - Special order statistics include finding the smallest (k=1), largest (k=n), and median (k=n/2) elements.
  - **Discussion on Median and Selection Algorithms**
    - Sorting the data and selecting the kth element takes O(n log n) time but provides full order information.
    - A randomized expected O(n) algorithm based on quicksort selects a pivot and recursively partitions data.
    - Worst-case linear time algorithms exist but are more complex and less practical than the expected-time method.
    - Streaming data and single-pass constraints necessitate approximate selection methods, including random sampling.
    - Computing the mode requires O(n log n) time due to element uniqueness lower bounds and sorting.
    - Improvements on mode finding may leverage fast median computations under special conditions.
  - **Implementation and Further Notes**
    - The C++ STL offers the nth_element function, an implementation of the linear expected-time selection algorithm.
    - Hoare’s algorithm is foundational for linear time median and selection; Floyd and Rivest’s method reduces comparisons on average.
    - Streaming algorithms for large data sets are well-reviewed by Muthukrishnan.
    - Theoretical bounds on median comparisons have been established by Dor and Zwick, showing 2.95n comparisons suffice.
    - Tight combinatorial bounds and optimal algorithms for mode computation are documented in the cited literature.

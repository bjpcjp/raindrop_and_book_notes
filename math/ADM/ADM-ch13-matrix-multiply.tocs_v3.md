- **Matrix Multiplication Input and Output**
  - Describes multiplying an x × y matrix A by a y × z matrix B to produce an x × z matrix.
  - The example given illustrates the input matrices and the resulting product matrix.
  - Matrix multiplication is computed by summing over the shared dimension y.

- **18.7 Finite State Machine Minimization**
  - **Minimizing deterministic finite state machines**
    - Minimizing DFAs reduces storage and execution costs by eliminating redundant states.
    - The algorithm partitions states into equivalence classes based on acceptance and transition behavior.
    - The classical algorithm runs in O(n¬≤) time, while an optimal O(n log n) algorithm by Hopcroft exists.
    - Final equivalence classes correspond to the minimized automaton states.
    - See [Hopcroft‚Äôs Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DFA_minimization#Hopcroft's_algorithm) for more detail.
  - **Constructing deterministic machines from nondeterministic machines**
    - Any NFA can be converted to an equivalent DFA, but conversion may cause exponential increase in states.
    - NFA states represent subsets of DFA states since NFAs can be in multiple states simultaneously.
    - Minimizing the resulting DFA can reduce states, but NFA minimization is PSPACE-hard.
    - This equivalence underlies foundational automata theory and complicates practical implementation.
    - Refer to [NFA to DFA Conversion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deterministic_finite_automaton#From_NFA_to_DFA) for further explanations.
  - **Constructing machines from regular expressions**
    - Regular expressions translate to automata either as NFAs with ùúñ-moves or as DFAs via derivatives.
    - NFAs with ùúñ-moves are simpler to construct and have O(m) states for an expression of length m.
    - DFA construction may require O(2^m) states in the worst case, causing exponential space blowup.
    - Simulating an input string on a DFA takes linear time regardless of automaton size.
    - Brzozowski‚Äôs derivatives method is a key approach; see [Brzozowski‚Äôs Derivatives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brzozowski_derivative) for details.

  - **Historical notes and references**
    - Thompson introduced the ùúñ-move technique for regular expression pattern matching.
    - Hopcroft‚Äôs O(n log n) algorithm is a landmark result for DFA minimization.
    - The CIAA conference serves as a major venue for automata implementations and applications.
    - Classic textbooks include [Aho et al., 1990](https://www.amazon.com/Algorithms-Strings-Trees-Applications-Computer/dp/0201558034) and [Hopcroft et al., 2006].
    - The PSPACE-completeness of NFA problems distinguishes them from DFA problems in computational complexity.

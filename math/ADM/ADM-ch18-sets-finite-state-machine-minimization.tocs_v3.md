- **18.7 Finite State Machine Minimization**
  - **Minimizing deterministic finite state machines**
    - Minimization eliminates redundant states to reduce both storage and execution costs.
    - The basic algorithm partitions states into equivalence classes and refines them based on transition behavior.
    - The classical approach runs in O(n²) time, while Hopcroft's algorithm achieves O(n log n) efficiency.
    - Final equivalence classes correspond to the states in the minimized automaton.
    - See Hopcroft [Hop71] for the O(n log n) minimization algorithm.
  - **Constructing deterministic machines from nondeterministic machines**
    - NFAs can exist in multiple states simultaneously, whereas DFAs are in exactly one state.
    - Any NFA can be converted to an equivalent DFA, though this can cause exponential state blowup.
    - Minimizing DFA after conversion can reduce excessive states from NFA blowup.
    - The exponential blowup and minimization of NFAs is PSPACE-hard, complicating implementation.
    - Refer to standard automata theory texts like [Sip05] for proofs and explanations.
  - **Constructing machines from regular expressions**
    - Two approaches exist: constructing NFAs (using ϵ-moves) or constructing DFAs directly.
    - NFA construction via ϵ-moves is straightforward and yields O(m) states for regex length m.
    - DFA construction via the derivatives method creates states as needed but can require O(2^m) states in worst cases.
    - Simulation on a DFA is linear time regardless of automaton size.
    - For more, see Brzozowski [Brz64] on derivatives method and Thompson [Tho68] on ϵ-moves.
  - **Implementations and software tools**
    - Grail+ is a C++ package enabling conversion and minimization of automata on large alphabets.
    - AT&T FSM Library supports massive automata (over ten million states/transitions) on UNIX.
    - JFLAP provides graphical tools for learning and converting between DFAs, NFAs, and regex.
    - FIRE Engine implements multiple minimization algorithms including Hopcroft’s O(n log n) method.

- **Input and Problem Description**
  - The input consists of n items with sizes and m bins with specified capacities.
  - The goal is to store all items using the smallest number of bins.
  - Bin packing has practical applications in manufacturing and shipping to minimize cost and waste.
  - Bin packing complexity is NP-complete, necessitating heuristics rather than optimal algorithms.
- **Factors Affecting Bin Packing**
  - **Shapes and Sizes of Objects**
    - Problem character depends heavily on object shapes and sizes.
    - One-dimensional bin packing treats sizes as integers, akin to equal-width boxes into a container.
    - Identical box sizes simplify packing but may not yield optimal results.
  - **Constraints on Orientation and Placement**
    - Labels like “this side up” or “do not stack” impose packing restrictions.
    - Restrictive labels often increase the number of bins required.
    - Ignoring such labels simplifies the packing task.
  - **On-line vs Off-line Problems**
    - Off-line problems have complete knowledge of all items upfront.
    - On-line problems receive items sequentially and must pack as they arrive.
    - Planning and sorting items before packing improves efficiency in off-line problems.
- **Heuristics for Bin Packing**
  - Standard off-line heuristics sort items and insert them based on various bin selection rules.
  - First-fit decreasing is the best heuristic: sort descending by size, insert into the first bin with space.
  - First-fit decreasing guarantees using no more than 22% more bins than optimal in one dimension.
  - Implementation can be O(n log n + b n) time or improved to O(n log n) with binary tree space management.
  - Adaptations exist to handle problem-specific constraints like stacking and orientation.
- **Packing Arbitrary Shapes**
  - Packing arbitrary geometric shapes is simplified by enclosing each part in its minimal bounding box.
  - Finding orientation minimizing box area/volume is possible in two and three dimensions.
  - Nonconvex parts can waste space; maximum empty rectangle inside a box can mitigate this.
  - More advanced spatial packing strategies exist for irregular shapes.
- **Implementations and References**
  - Fortran algorithms for knapsack and bin packing by Martello and Toth are available online.
  - David Pisinger maintains C codes for knapsack and related packing problems.
  - A near-linear time approximation algorithm for optimal packing can be accessed online.
  - Surveys include [CFC94, CGJ96, LMM02]; latest knapsack references include [KPP04].
- **Notes and Related Topics**
  - Efficient algorithms exist for finding the largest empty rectangle in shapes and point sets.
  - Sphere packing is a notable bin packing special case with links to error-correcting codes.
  - Kepler conjecture on sphere packing density was resolved in 1998.

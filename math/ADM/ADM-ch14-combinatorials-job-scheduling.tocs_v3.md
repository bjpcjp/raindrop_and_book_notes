- **Job Scheduling**
  - **Input description**
    - The input is a directed acyclic graph where vertices represent jobs and edges imply precedence constraints.
    - Each edge (u, v) means job u must be completed before job v.
    - The graph must be acyclic to avoid unsolvable dependency cycles.
  - **Problem description**
    - The problem seeks a schedule that completes all jobs in minimum time or with minimum processors.
    - Proper scheduling avoids bottlenecks and inefficient processor use.
    - Examples include assigning people to jobs, meetings to rooms, and courses to exam periods.
  - **Related scheduling problems and techniques**
    - Topological sorting creates schedules consistent with precedence constraints.
    - Bipartite matching assigns jobs to suitably skilled people.
    - Vertex and edge coloring schedule jobs into non-conflicting time slots.
    - Traveling salesman and Eulerian cycle solve route efficiency problems in scheduling.
  - **Precedence-constrained scheduling for DAGs**
    - Critical paths are the longest paths which determine the minimum total completion time.
    - Minimum completion time with unlimited workers equals the length of the critical path.
    - Completion time can be computed in O(n + m) time using topological order and scheduling jobs as soon as prerequisites complete.
    - Optimizing trade-offs between number of workers and completion time is NP-complete.
  - **Approaches to complex scheduling constraints**
    - Simplify constraints to known problem types, solve, then adjust schedules manually if needed.
    - Use linear-integer programming to model and solve more complex constraints.
  - **Job-shop scheduling without precedence constraints**
    - Assign jobs to identical machines to minimize total elapsed time.
    - Modeled as a bin-packing problem where machines are bins and jobs are items with time sizes.
    - Heuristics exist for tasks with allowable start and finish times.
    - Preemption and task splitting simplify scheduling significantly.

- **14.4 Generating Permutations**
  - **Input description and problem statement**
    - The input is an integer n for generating permutations of length n.
    - The problem involves generating all, a random, or the next permutation of length n.
    - Permutations describe arrangements or orderings critical to many algorithmic problems.
  - **Permutation count and order**
    - There are n! permutations of n items, which grows very rapidly (e.g., 12! = 479,001,600).
    - Generating all permutations for n > 12 is impractical due to factorial growth.
    - Lexicographic order is the natural numeric sorting order for permutations.
  - **Ranking and Unranking paradigms**
    - Ranking assigns a numeric position to a permutation within an ordered set.
    - Unranking finds the permutation corresponding to a given numeric position.
    - Rank and unrank functions must be inverses: unrank(rank(p), n) = p.
    - Examples illustrate recursive ranking and unranking for permutations.
  - **Applications of ranking and unranking**
    - Sequencing permutations by computing next or previous order permutations.
    - Generating random permutations by selecting a random rank and unranking it.
    - Tracking seen permutations efficiently with bit vectors indexed by rank.
  - **Incremental change methods**
    - Generate permutations by sequences of swaps between elements.
    - These algorithms are concise and can run in average constant time per permutation.
    - Only a single swap occurs between successive permutations.
    - Minimum change order ensures swaps involve adjacent elements, as in Johnson-Trotter.
  - **Permutations with duplicates**
    - Multisets with duplicates require methods to avoid producing identical permutations.
    - Use backtracking and lexicographic order to generate distinct permutations.
  - **Random permutation generation algorithms**
    - The recommended algorithm initializes the array and swaps each element with a random element from its current position onward.
    - An alternative algorithm swapping with any element from the entire array fails to produce uniform permutations.
    - Empirical testing is advised to verify uniformity of random permutation generators.
  - **Implementations and references**
    - C++ STL provides next_permutation and prev_permutation functions for lexicographic order sequencing.
    - Resources include Kreher and Stinson implementations, Combinatorial Object Server, and Nijenhuis and Wilf's Fortran routines.
    - Combinatorica offers Mathematica implementations for various permutation operations.
    - Notable literature includes Knuth [Knu05a] and Sedgewick [Sed77].
    - Myrvold and Ruskey provide linear-time ranking/unranking algorithms.
    - For historical methods, see Magee and Olkin [MO63].

    - Generating subsets.
    - Generating partitions.

- **17.5 Nearest Neighbor Search**
  - **Problem Description**
    - Identifies the closest point in a set S of n points in d dimensions to a query point q.
    - Applied in emergency dispatch systems to minimize response times.
    - Relevant for classification tasks by assigning labels based on nearest neighbors.
  - **Applications**
    - Used in political preference classification by proximity in multidimensional feature space.
    - Applies in image compression via vector quantization by mapping image regions to closest library tiles in 64-dimensional space.
  - **Key Issues in Nearest-Neighbor Search**
    - Performance depends on the size of the data set and number of queries; brute force suffices for small n or few queries.
    - Dimensionality adversely affects efficiency; kd-trees work well up to about 20 dimensions.
    - Voronoi diagrams provide efficient nearest-neighbor queries in two dimensions but become impractical in higher dimensions.
    - Exact nearest neighbors are costly to find in high dimensions; approximate methods using dimension reduction and randomness help.
    - Dynamic data sets require adaptable data structures; kd-trees with insertion/deletion support can be used.
  - **Data Structures and Algorithms**
    - The nearest neighbor graph is a subgraph of the Delaunay triangulation and computable in O(n log n).
    - Closest-pair problem relates to sorting and minimum gap detection between adjacent sorted elements.
  - **Implementations and Tools**
    - ANN: C++ library for exact and approximate nearest neighbor search across multiple lp norms, effective up to ~20 dimensions ([ANN](http://www.cs.umd.edu/~mount/ANN/)).
    - Samet’s spatial index demos provide Java applets for kd-tree variants ([Samet’s Demos](http://donar.umiacs.umd.edu/quadtree/)).
    - KDTREE 2: C++ and Fortran 95 kd-tree implementations ([KDTREE 2](http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0408067)).
    - Ranger: visualization tool for multiple multidimensional search trees ([Ranger](http://www.cs.sunysb.edu/~algorith)).
    - Nearpt3: specialized for extremely large 3D point sets ([Nearpt3](http://wrfranklin.org/Research/nearpt3)).
    - CGAL and LEDA libraries provide Voronoi diagram implementations in C++ with planar point location ([CGAL](https://www.cgal.org)).
  - **Additional Notes and References**
    - Indyk’s survey details approximate nearest neighbor search via random projection methods ([Ind04]).
    - ANN's theoretical approach uses sparse weighted graphs and greedy walks to find neighbors ([AM93], [AMN+ 98]).
    - Samet’s works are authoritative on kd-trees and spatial data structures ([Sam06], [Sam05]).
    - Random perturbation method for improving nearest neighbor search efficiency is credited to [Pan06].
    - Closest pair algorithms use divide-and-conquer rather than only Delaunay triangulations ([BS76], [CLRS01], [Man89]).

- **16.8 Edge Coloring**
  - **Input description**
    - The input is a graph G = (V, E).
  - **Problem description**
    - Determine the smallest set of colors to color edges so no two edges sharing a vertex have the same color.
    - Edge coloring models scheduling problems by assigning time slots to tasks without conflicts.
  - **Discussion**
    - Edge coloring is equivalent to scheduling noninterfering rounds of tasks.
    - The National Football League uses edge coloring for season scheduling with additional constraints.
  - **Edge-chromatic number**
    - The minimum number of colors needed is called the edge-chromatic number or chromatic index.
    - Even-length cycles have an edge-chromatic number of 2; odd-length cycles have 3.
  - **Vizing's theorem**
    - Any graph with maximum vertex degree Δ can be edge colored with at most Δ + 1 colors.
    - Any edge coloring requires at least Δ colors.
    - The theorem's constructive proof yields an O(nmΔ) algorithm for edge coloring.
  - **Computational complexity**
    - Deciding edge coloring with fewer than Δ + 1 colors is NP-complete.
  - **Line graph transformation**
    - Edge coloring of G can be transformed to vertex coloring of the line graph L(G).
    - The line graph L(G) has a vertex for each edge of G and edges between vertices that share an endpoint in G.
  - **Implementations**
    - An implementation of Vizing’s algorithm exists as a C++ project by Yan Dong.
    - GOBLIN software implements branch-and-bound methods for edge coloring.
    - Vertex coloring codes can be applied to line graphs for edge coloring.
    - Combinatorica provides Mathematica implementations for edge coloring via line graphs.
  - **Notes**
    - Vizing and Gupta independently proved the Δ + 1 upper bound for edge coloring.
    - Misra and Gries provide a simple constructive proof of Vizing’s theorem.
    - Computing the exact edge-chromatic number is NP-complete.
    - Bipartite graphs allow polynomial-time edge coloring.
    - Whitney’s work on line graphs relates isomorphisms except for K3 and K1,3.
    - The line graph of Eulerian graphs is both Eulerian and Hamiltonian.
    - The line graph of Hamiltonian graphs is always Hamiltonian.
  - **Related problems**
    - Vertex coloring and scheduling are related to edge coloring.

- **Text Compression**
  - **Input description**
    - The input is a text string S.
    - The goal is to produce a shorter text string Sâ€² from which S can be exactly reconstructed.
  - **Problem description**
    - Data compression seeks space-efficient encodings for given data files.
    - The increase in data volume and storage capacity influences the importance of compression.
  - **Discussion**
    - Secondary storage devices fill quickly despite growing capacity.
    - Compression improves effective network bandwidth by reducing bits transmitted.
    - Preprocessing such as removing redundant spaces or applying the Burrows-Wheeler transform improves compressibility.
    - Lossless encoding is required for document storage, while lossy encoding yields higher compression in multimedia.
    - Patented algorithms such as LZW have licensing considerations; alternatives often exist.
    - Compression algorithms must be chosen based on input type, real-time requirements, and tradeoffs between compression ratio and speed.
    - Popular lossy compression methods like JPEG and MPEG are recommended for audio/video/image data.
  - **Common issues in selecting compression algorithms**
    - Lossy vs. lossless encoding depends on the exactness needed after decompression.
    - Data simplification before compression enhances performance.
    - Patent status can affect algorithm choice and implementation.
    - Image compression frequently uses run-length coding for similar pixel value runs.
    - Real-time decompression may take precedence over compression speed.
  - **Types of text compression algorithms**
    - **Huffman codes**
      - Assign variable-length codes based on character frequency.
      - Constructed via a greedy algorithm combining least frequent symbols repeatedly.
      - Resulting codes reduce space by assigning shorter codes to common symbols.
      - Require two passes over the document and explicit storage of the coding table.
      - Best for exploiting symbol frequency, less effective on higher-order redundancies.
      - Refer to [CLRS01] and [AHU83] for implementations and theory.
    - **Lempel-Ziv algorithms**
      - Build coding tables dynamically as the text is read.
      - Adapt to local text changes and exploit repeated substrings of variable length.
      - Robust across different data types and often outperform application-specific algorithms.
      - Used by popular programs like gzip implementing Lempel-Ziv variations.
      - Recommended for general use due to balance of speed and compression quality.
  - **Transforms and preprocessing**
    - The Burrows-Wheeler transform rearranges text cyclic shifts to create runs of repeated characters.
    - Results in 10-15% higher compressibility than the original text.
    - Computable in linear time and perfectly reversible if the last character is unique.
    - Used by programs like bzip2 for tighter compression than gzip.
  - **Implementations and recommendations**
    - gzip uses a Lempel-Ziv based public domain algorithm under GNU license.
    - bzip2 utilizes the Burrows-Wheeler transform for improved compression at higher cost.
    - Extensive comparisons and software are available at [Maximum Compression](http://www.maximumcompression.com/).

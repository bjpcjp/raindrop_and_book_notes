- **Dynamic Programming**
  - **Caching vs. Computation**
    - Dynamic programming trades space for time by caching results to avoid repeated computations.
    - Recursive Fibonacci calculation is exponential in time due to recomputation of subproblems.
    - Caching computed Fibonacci values reduces time complexity to linear.
    - Further optimization removes recursion by iteratively computing Fibonacci numbers.
    - See [The Algorithm Design Manual](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-84800-070-4) for deeper insight.
  - **Approximate String Matching**
    - Measures string similarity using edit distance with operations: substitution, insertion, deletion.
    - Recursive approaches to edit distance have exponential time complexity due to repeated subproblems.
    - Dynamic programming implementation using a matrix stores subproblem results, yielding O(|P||T|) time.
    - Reconstruction of the edit path is done using parent pointers stored during computation.
    - Special cases include substring matching and longest common subsequence using tailored cost functions.
  - **Longest Increasing Sequence**
    - Defines li as the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at element si.
    - Recurrence: li = max(lj + 1 for all j < i where sj < si), l0 = 0.
    - Algorithm runs in O(n^2) time; can be improved to O(n log n) with advanced data structures.
    - Stores predecessor indices to reconstruct the subsequence.
  - **War Story: Evolution of the Lobster**
    - Morphing images requires finding correspondences between features in two lines of pixels.
    - Problem modeled as aligning runs of pixels without crossing matches.
    - Dynamic programming finds minimal cost alignment considering merges, splits, and positional offsets.
    - Demonstrated by morphing a lobster into a human head.
  - **The Partition Problem**
    - Problem: partition sequence S into k contiguous parts minimizing the maximum sum in any part.
    - Dynamic programming recurrence computes optimal partition cost M[n,k] using prefix sums.
    - Algorithm runs in O(k n^2) time, improving over naive exponential search.
    - Uses auxiliary matrix D to reconstruct the partitions.
  - **Parsing Context-Free Grammars**
    - Parsing uses dynamic programming to identify valid nonterminals generating substrings.
    - The CKY algorithm evaluates M[i,j,X] booleans; parses input in O(n^3) time.
    - Generalized to minimal edits with costs to handle errors or substitutions.
    - Also applicable to minimum weight triangulation of polygons solved via similar recurrences.
  - **Limitations of Dynamic Programming: TSP**
    - Dynamic programming requires the principle of optimality and inherent ordering of subproblems.
    - Longest simple path and traveling salesman problems lack such ordering and have exponential states.
    - Advanced DP formulations reduce complexity but remain exponential and limited to small inputs.
    - Highlights necessity of problem structure and ordering for efficient DP application.
  - **War Story: What’s Past is Prolog**
    - Minimizing trie size for Prolog rule heads optimized by permuting argument order.
    - Preserving lexicographical order of leaves enables a polynomial DP solution.
    - Problem is NP-complete without order constraint but solvable efficiently with ordering.
    - DP partitions rules by character runs and finds minimal total trie size.
  - **War Story: Text Compression for Bar Codes**
    - PDF-417 two-dimensional bar codes store text with multiple modes of character sets.
    - Encoding uses mode latch and shift commands with variable length character coding.
    - Greedy heuristics improved by a DP algorithm that finds the minimal bit encoding.
    - DP runs in O(n) time and yields average 8% compression improvement over heuristic.
    - Compression optimization critical for space-limited bar code labels.

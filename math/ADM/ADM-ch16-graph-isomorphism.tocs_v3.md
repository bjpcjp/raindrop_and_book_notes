- **Graph Isomorphism**
  - **Problem Description**
    - Graph isomorphism tests whether there exists a vertex mapping between two graphs such that edges correspond exactly.
    - The problem detects if two graphs are identical by preserving edges under a vertex mapping.
    - It can be used to identify graph duplicates, avoiding redundant computation.
  - **Applications and Variations**
    - Subgraph isomorphism checks if a smaller graph is contained within a larger one, with induced subgraph isomorphism imposing stricter conditions.
    - Graph labeling constraints speed up isomorphism testing by pruning invalid vertex pairings.
    - Specialized algorithms exist for trees and planar graphs that exploit structural properties to speed up matching.
  - **Algorithmic Approach**
    - The basic algorithm involves backtracking through all vertex permutations to find isomorphisms.
    - Vertex equivalence classes based on invariants such as degree, shortest path distances, and counts of length-k paths dramatically reduce the search space.
    - Highly symmetric graphs are more challenging due to larger equivalence classes.
  - **Practical Implementations**
    - Nauty is a leading C library providing efficient automorphism group computations and canonical labeling.
    - VFLib offers multiple algorithms for graph and subgraph isomorphism with comprehensive benchmarking.
    - GraphGrep supports graph querying in large graph databases.
    - Valiente’s implementations focus on tree and subgraph isomorphism atop LEDA.
  - **Complexity and Theoretical Notes**
    - Graph isomorphism is neither known to be NP-complete nor proven to be solvable in polynomial time.
    - Known polynomial algorithms exist for specific graph classes like planar graphs and bounded-degree graphs.
    - The problem lies uniquely between P and NP-complete in complexity theory.
    - Related concepts include automorphisms and isomorphism-complete problems such as bipartite graph isomorphism.

- **14.10 Satisfiability**
  - **Input description**
    - The input is a set of clauses expressed in conjunctive normal form (CNF).
    - Each clause is a disjunction (OR) of literals.
  - **Problem description**
    - The problem asks if there exists a truth assignment to Boolean variables that satisfies every clause simultaneously.
    - This checks for a configuration consistent with all logical constraints.
  - **Discussion**
    - Satisfiability (SAT) is the original NP-complete problem foundational to complexity theory.
    - CNF formulas require all clauses to be true; DNF formulas require any clause to be true.
    - Converting between CNF and DNF can cause exponential growth in formula size, affecting complexity.
    - Special cases: 1-SAT is trivial, 2-SAT solvable in linear time, and 3-SAT is NP-complete.
  - **Issues in satisfiability testing**
    - CNF or DNF form influences solution difficulty; DNF satisfiability is trivial unless contradictory clauses exist.
    - Clause size (k) affects complexity, with 3-SAT marking NP-completeness threshold.
    - Exact satisfiability requires backtracking algorithms like Davis-Putnam; many heuristics and pruning exist.
    - Relaxations focus on maximizing the number of satisfiable clauses for optimization.
  - **Implementations**
    - Modern SAT solvers have progressed considerably and participate in annual competitions.
    - Leading solvers as of 2007 include Rsat, PicoSAT, and MiniSAT, all available online.
    - SAT Live! offers current papers, programs, and test sets for satisfiability research.
  - **Notes**
    - The Davis-Putnam-Logemann-Loveland (DPLL) algorithm is a foundational backtracking method.
    - Local search techniques complement DPLL, especially for hard problem classes.
    - Influential solvers include Chaﬀ; surveys cover ongoing SAT solver developments.
    - Faster worst-case algorithms exist for 3-SAT, but all remain non-polynomial.
    - Garey and Johnson [GJ79] is the main reference on NP-completeness.
    - Additional references include works on Cook’s theorem, Karp’s hardness results, and 2-SAT algorithms.
  - **Related Problems**
    - Constrained optimization problems and the traveling salesman problem share relevant complexity aspects.

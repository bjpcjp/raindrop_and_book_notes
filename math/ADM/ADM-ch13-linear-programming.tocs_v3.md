- **Linear Programming**
  - **Input Description**
    - Specifies a set S of n linear inequalities on m variables in the form \(\sum_{j=1}^m c_{ij} \cdot x_j \ge b_i\), for \(1 \le i \le n\).
    - Defines the linear optimization function \(f(X) = \sum_{j=1}^m c_j \cdot x_j\).
  - **Problem Description**
    - Seeks the variable assignment \(X^*\) that maximizes the objective function \(f\) while satisfying all inequalities S.
  - **Applications**
    - Includes resource allocation scenarios where investment is optimized subject to constraints.
    - Approximates solutions for overdetermined and inconsistent linear equation systems minimizing error terms.
    - Provides solutions or reductions for numerous graph algorithms and combinatorial optimization problems.
  - **Algorithmic Approach**
    - The simplex method operates by iteratively moving to higher vertices within the convex feasible region.
    - Sophisticated data structures improve performance on large, sparse problems.
    - Interior-point methods provide efficient alternatives by traversing the interior of the solution space.
  - **Implementation Considerations**
    - Advises using existing LP solver software over custom implementations for efficiency and robustness.
    - Highlights numerical stability, pivot rule selection, and sparsity in large-scale problem handling.
  - **Common Issues**
    - Integrality Constraints: Differentiates between linear, integer, and mixed integer programs; integer programming is NP-complete.
    - Variable vs Constraint Count: Notes preference for primal or dual LP formulation depending on relative sizes.
    - Nonlinearity: Addresses challenges and strategies for nonlinear and quadratic programming problems.
    - Input Model Compatibility: Describes transformations to standard form (nonnegative variables, minimization objective, equality constraints).
  - **Available Implementations**
    - Mentions free solvers: lp_solve (handles MIP), CLP (fast on LPs), and GLPK (large-scale LP and MIP).
    - References NEOS for remote optimization service access.
    - Cites Algorithm 551 and 552 for simplex-based overdetermined systems in Fortran.
    - Provides official repository links such as [lp_solve](http://lpsolve.sourceforge.net/5.5/), [COIN-OR CLP](http://www.coin-or.org/), [GLPK](http://www.gnu.org/software/glpk/).
  - **Historical and Theoretical Notes**
    - The simplex algorithm was invented by George Dantzig in 1947.
    - Worst-case exponential complexity demonstrated by Klee and Minty, but practical performance is efficient.
    - Smoothed analysis explains typical simplex efficiency; recent polynomial-time randomized simplex algorithms have been developed.
    - Khachian's ellipsoid algorithm proved polynomial-time solvability in 1979; Karmarkar's interior-point method improved practical and theoretical results.
    - Semidefinite programming generalizes and extends linear programming to matrix variables and quadratic constraints.
    - Linear programming is P-complete under log-space reductions, implying unlikely existence of efficient parallel algorithms under standard complexity assumptions.
  - **Related Problems**
    - Directly relates to constrained and unconstrained optimization methods.
    - Network flow problems are special cases of linear programming formulations.

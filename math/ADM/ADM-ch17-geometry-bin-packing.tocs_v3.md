- **Bin Packing**
  - **Input description**
    - The input consists of n items with sizes \(d_1, \ldots, d_n\) and m bins with capacities \(c_1, \ldots, c_m\).
    - The goal is to store all items using the smallest number of bins.
  - **Problem description**
    - Bin packing problems arise in packaging and manufacturing contexts such as cutting widgets from materials or fitting boxes into trucks.
    - The cutting stock problem is a variant involving placement and layout within bins.
  - **Computational complexity and heuristics**
    - Bin packing is NP-complete, requiring heuristic rather than worst-case optimal solutions.
    - Factors affecting heuristics include object shapes and sizes, orientation and placement constraints, and whether the problem is offline or online.
    - Offline problems allow sorting and global planning, improving packing efficiency.
    - [Knapsack problem discussion (Section 13.10)](Page 427) provides related complexity context.
  - **Heuristic insertion rules**
    - Common insertion strategies include first-fit, best-fit, tightest-fit, and random bin selection.
    - First-fit decreasing (FFD) is the best-performing heuristic, sorting objects by decreasing size and placing them in the first bin that fits.
    - FFD can be implemented in \(O(n \log n + bn)\), or optimized to \(O(n \log n)\) using binary trees.
  - **Handling constraints and variants**
    - Problem-specific constraints such as "do not stack" or fixed orientation can be managed by adjusting insertion order.
    - Packing arbitrary shapes is more complex; placing parts in minimum-volume enclosing boxes is a common approach.
    - Finding minimum enclosing rectangles and maximum empty rectangles aids more efficient packing within boxes.
  - **Implementations**
    - Martello and Toth’s Fortran implementations cover knapsack variants, available at [http://www.or.deis.unibo.it/kp.html](http://www.or.deis.unibo.it/kp.html).
    - David Pisinger maintains C-language codes for bin packing and container loading at [http://www.diku.dk/~pisinger/codes.html](http://www.diku.dk/~pisinger/codes.html).
    - A near-linear time approximation for packing arbitrary shapes is available at [http://valis.cs.uiuc.edu/~sariel/research/papers/00/diameter/diam_prog.html](http://valis.cs.uiuc.edu/~sariel/research/papers/00/diameter/diam_prog.html).
  - **Notes**
    - Surveys of bin packing and cutting stock problems are found in [CFC94, CGJ96, LMM02].
    - The knapsack problem and variants are reviewed by Keller, Pferschy, and Pisinger [KPP04].
    - Experimental studies on bin-packing heuristics include [BJLM83, MT87].
    - Efficient algorithms exist to find the largest empty rectangle inside polygons [DMR97] and point sets [CDL86].
    - Sphere packing relates to bin packing; the Kepler conjecture on densest sphere packing was resolved by Hales and Ferguson (1998) [Szp03].
    - Conway and Sloane’s work [CS93] is authoritative on sphere packing.
    - Milenkovic’s research addresses two-dimensional bin packing for apparel manufacturing [DM97, Mil97].
  - **Related Problems**
    - The knapsack problem (Page 427) and set packing (Page 625) are closely related to bin packing.

- **Graph Problems: Hard Problems**
  - **Independent Set**
    - The independent set problem seeks the largest vertex subset with no two vertices adjacent in the graph.  
    - It relates closely to facility location, coding theory, and scheduling problems where conflicts must be avoided.  
    - Maximum independent set is algorithmically identical to maximum clique in the graph complement and connected to vertex coloring problems.  
    - A basic heuristic selects the lowest-degree vertex, adds it to the independent set, and removes it and its neighbors, repeating until empty.  
    - Efficient solutions exist for trees and bipartite graphs, while the general problem remains NP-complete.  
    - Algorithmic resources include branch-and-bound from GOBLIN and GRASP heuristics by Resende et al.

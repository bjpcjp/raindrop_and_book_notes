- **Set Packing**
  - **Input description**
    - The input is a set of subsets \( S = \{S_1, \ldots, S_m\} \) of the universal set \( U = \{1, \ldots, n\} \).
  - **Problem description**
    - The goal is to select a collection of mutually disjoint subsets from \( S \) whose union is the universal set.
    - The problem requires that no element is covered by more than one selected subset.
  - **Discussion**
    - Set packing problems model constraints where subsets cannot overlap, related to independent set problems in graphs.
    - Applications include scheduling airline flight crews with constraints on crew composition and assignments.
    - Variations include exact cover, requiring every element to appear exactly once, which is NP-complete.
    - Partial solutions using singleton subsets allow expansion into exact covers by covering leftover elements.
    - Problems lying between set cover and exact cover can be approached by penalizing subsets covering already covered elements.
    - Greedy heuristics select subsets based on size and remove conflicting subsets, sometimes enhanced by randomization or exhaustive search.
    - Integer programming formulations use 0-1 variables to represent subset selection and enforce coverage constraints.
  - **Implementations**
    - Set cover implementations can be adapted to support set packing constraints.
    - Pascal codes for exhaustive search and heuristics are referenced in [SDK83].
    - SYMPHONY provides a mixed-integer linear programming solver with set partitioning capabilities.
  - **Notes**
    - Survey articles on set packing include [BP76, Pas97].
    - Combinatorial auction bidding strategies reduce to set-packing problems as discussed in [dVV03].
    - Set-packing relaxations and reduction rules are detailed in [BW00] and [SDK83], including application to airplane scheduling.
  - **Related Problems**
    - Independent set problems relate closely, as do set cover problems.

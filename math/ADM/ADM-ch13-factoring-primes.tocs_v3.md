- **13.8 Factoring and Primality Testing**
  - **Input description**
    - The input is an integer \( n \).
    - The problem is to determine if \( n \) is prime or find its factors if composite.
  - **Problem description and discussion**
    - Factoring and primality testing are central to RSA cryptography security.
    - Hash tables perform better when sized by prime numbers, requiring prime identification.
    - Integer factorization and primality testing are related but use different algorithms.
  - **Basic algorithms**
    - Trial division involves testing divisors up to \(\sqrt{n}\) to find factors or prove primality.
    - Multiplicities of factors and primes larger than \(\sqrt{n}\) must be handled correctly.
    - Trial division is not polynomial time since input size grows logarithmically with \( n \).
  - **Efficiency improvements**
    - Precomputed small prime tables reduce trial division steps.
    - Bit vectors efficiently represent large prime sets, e.g., odd numbers under 1,000,000.
  - **Advanced algorithms**
    - Faster but still exponential-time algorithms like number field sieve factor very large integers (e.g., hundreds of digits).
    - Randomized algorithms, based on Fermat’s little theorem, quickly test primality without full factorization.
  - **Prime distribution insights**
    - Prime Number Theorem estimates the count of primes less than \( n \) as approximately \( n/\ln n \).
    - Gaps between primes are never large; roughly \(\ln n\) checks suffice to find the next prime above \( n \).
  - **Software implementations**
    - PARI handles arbitrary-precision integers and many mathematical functions, available at [PARI](http://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/).
    - LiDIA implements modern factorization methods, available at [LiDIA](http://www.cdc.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/TI/LiDIA/).
    - NTL provides data structures and algorithms for large integers and algebraic structures, found at [NTL](http://www.shoup.net/ntl/).
    - MIRACL library includes six integer factorization algorithms including quadratic sieve, at [MIRACL](http://www.shamus.ie/).
  - **Historical and theoretical notes**
    - The AKS algorithm proved primality testing is in deterministic polynomial time.
    - Miller-Rabin algorithm reliably tests primality, overcoming Fermat test weaknesses.
    - Integer factorization records include factoring RSA-129 over eight months with distributed computation and RSA-200 requiring 55 CPU years.
    - The problem’s complexity relates to P vs NP questions, with compositeness testing now in P.

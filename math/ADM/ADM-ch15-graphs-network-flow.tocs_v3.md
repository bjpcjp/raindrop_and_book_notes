- **Network Flow**
  - **Input Description**
    - A directed graph G is provided where each edge (i, j) has a capacity cij.
    - The problem includes a specified source node s and sink node t.
    - The objective is to find the maximum flow from s to t respecting edge capacities.
  - **Problem Description**
    - Maximum flow seeks the greatest possible flow from s to t constrained by edge capacities.
    - The flow variables xij respect capacities 0 ≤ xij ≤ cij and flow conservation at all vertices except s and t.
    - The goal is to maximize the sum of flows leaving s or equivalently entering t.
  - **Discussion**
    - Network flow applies broadly beyond physical flow, including logistics and resource allocation.
    - Many linear programming problems can be modeled and solved faster using network flow methods.
    - Problems such as bipartite matching, shortest path, and connectivity relate closely to network flow.
  - **Primary Classes of Network Flow Problems**
    - **Maximum Flow**
      - Flow variables represent the amount sent on each edge bounded by capacity.
      - Flow conservation ensures equal inflow and outflow at all non-source/non-sink vertices.
      - The target is maximizing total flow entering the sink node t.
    - **Minimum Cost Flow**
      - Each edge has a cost dij per unit flow and a target flow amount f from s to t.
      - The problem minimizes total cost subject to capacity and flow amount constraints.
      - This extends maximum flow with an additional flow-cost objective.
  - **Special Considerations**
    - Multiple sources and sinks can be handled by introducing super-source and super-sink nodes.
    - Networks with edge capacities 0 or 1 admit faster specialized algorithms.
    - Uniform edge costs allow the use of maximum flow algorithms rather than minimum cost flow techniques.
    - Multicommodity flow models multiple types of flow with distinct source-destination pairs, but integral versions are NP-complete.
  - **Algorithms and Implementations**
    - **Augmenting Path Methods**
      - These algorithms successively find augmenting paths of positive capacity and improve flow.
      - Optimality is achieved when no augmenting path remains.
      - Choosing augmenting paths poorly can slow convergence substantially.
    - **Preflow-Push Methods**
      - These allow temporary violations of flow conservation to push flow more efficiently.
      - Multiple paths can be augmented in parallel, improving speed.
      - Considered the best choice for practical implementations.
    - **Available Implementations**
      - Goldberg’s HIPR and PRF codes for maximum flow are recommended, with HIPR preferred.
      - The CS code by Goldberg is preferred for minimum cost flow problems.
      - C++ libraries like GOBLIN and commercial LEDA offer extensive graph optimization capabilities.
      - The DIMACS challenge provides several network flow implementations and benchmarks.
  - **Notes**
    - The fundamental max-flow, min-cut theorem originates from Ford and Fulkerson.
    - Network flow algorithms have a steady history of improving time complexity, with fastest general algorithms running in O(nm log(n²/m)) time.
    - Multicommodity flow problems are computationally hard in integral cases.
    - Network coding theory uses information replication to achieve flow limits beyond traditional routing.

- **15.12 Planarity Detection and Embedding**  
  - **Input description**  
    - The input is a graph \( G \).  
  - **Problem description**  
    - Determine if \( G \) can be drawn in the plane with no two edges crossing.  
    - If planar, produce such a drawing or embedding.  
  - **Discussion**  
    - Planar drawings clarify graph structure by eliminating edge crossings.  
    - Planar graphs are sparse with \( |E| \leq 3|V| - 6 \) for nontrivial graphs.  
    - Every planar graph contains a vertex of degree at most 5 due to Euler’s formula.  
    - Planarity testing algorithms often use depth-first search and consider cycles and connecting paths.  
    - Insertion of paths incrementally can cause cramped and hard-to-understand drawings.  
    - Better algorithms produce planar-grid embeddings with vertices on a bounded grid for improved clarity.  
    - The crossing number minimization problem is NP-complete; heuristics find large planar subgraphs to embed.  
  - **Implementations**  
    - LEDA library provides linear-time planarity testing and planar-grid embeddings.  
    - JGraphEd Java framework includes PQ-tree and straight-line grid embedding algorithms.  
    - PIGALE C++ library focuses on planar graph drawings and planarity testing with obstruction identification.  
    - GRASP heuristics by Ribeiro and Resende implement largest planar subgraph finding in Fortran.  
  - **Notes**  
    - Kuratowski’s theorem states planar graphs exclude subgraphs homeomorphic to \( K_{3,3} \) or \( K_5 \).  
    - Fary’s theorem states every planar graph admits a straight-line embedding.  
    - Hopcroft and Tarjan provided the first linear-time planarity testing algorithm.  
    - Booth and Lueker developed a PQ-tree-based planarity test.  
    - Efficient planar grid embeddings were introduced by de Fraysseix, Pach, and Pollack.  
    - Nishizeki and Rahman’s book gives an overview of planar drawing algorithms.  
    - Outerplanar graphs can be recognized and embedded in linear time and exclude subgraphs homeomorphic to \( K_{2,3} \).  
  - **Related Problems**  
    - Graph partitioning and tree drawing are related graph problems addressed in other sections.

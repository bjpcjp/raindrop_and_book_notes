- **Edge and Vertex Connectivity**
  - **Input Description**
    - The input is a graph G, and optionally a pair of vertices s and t.
    - The problem focuses on finding the smallest subsets of vertices or edges that disconnect G or separate s from t.
  - **Problem Description and Discussion**
    - Edge connectivity is the smallest number of edges whose deletion disconnects the graph.
    - Vertex connectivity is the smallest number of vertices whose deletion disconnects the graph.
    - Vertex connectivity is always less than or equal to edge connectivity.
    - Minimum vertex degree is an upper bound for both edge and vertex connectivity.
    - Connectivity testing relates to network reliability, such as preventing communication in telephone networks.
  - **Connectivity Problems of Interest**
    - **Is the graph already disconnected?**
      - Testing connectivity is done by depth-first or breadth-first search.
      - For directed graphs, strong connectivity means a directed path between every pair of vertices.
    - **Is there one weak link in my graph?**
      - A graph is biconnected if no single vertex removal disconnects it.
      - Articulation vertices and bridges are single vertices or edges whose removal disconnects the graph.
      - Linear-time algorithms based on DFS exist to identify articulation points and bridges.
    - **What if I want to split the graph into equal-sized pieces?**
      - The graph partition problem seeks small cut sets dividing the graph into roughly equal parts.
      - The problem is NP-complete but solvable with heuristics.
    - **Are arbitrary cuts OK, or must I separate a given pair of vertices?**
      - Two problem types: minimum cut for the whole graph and minimum (s−t) cut.
      - Any (s−t) connectivity algorithm can be used for all pairs to find general connectivity.
      - For edge connectivity, n−1 runs suffice using a fixed vertex and all others.
  - **Network-Flow Techniques**
    - Maximum flow between two vertices equals the weight of the smallest edge cut disconnecting them.
    - Edge connectivity can be found by minimizing flows between a fixed vertex and all others.
    - Vertex connectivity relates to Menger’s theorem: k-connectivity equals existence of k vertex-disjoint paths.
    - Constructing a transformed graph with split vertices converts vertex-disjoint paths to edge-disjoint paths.
  - **Implementations and Libraries**
    - MINCUTLIB offers high-performance codes for various cut algorithms [MINCUTLIB](http://www.avglab.com/andrew/soft.html).
    - The Boost Graph Library supports connectivity and edge connectivity testing [Boost Graph Library](http://www.boost.org/libs/graph/doc).
    - GOBLIN and LEDA libraries provide extensive graph optimization and connectivity support.
    - Combinatorica in Mathematica offers edge and vertex connectivity routines with biconnected and strongly connected components.
  - **Notes on Algorithms and Theory**
    - Menger’s theorem underlies connectivity via number of disjoint paths.
    - Ford-Fulkerson theorem relates maximum flow to minimum cuts.
    - Karger’s randomized contraction algorithm finds minimum cuts in expected O(m log³ n) time.
    - Deterministic contraction algorithms exist with O(n(m + n log n)) time.
    - Non-flow-based k-connectivity algorithms run in O(k n²) time, with special cases for 3- and 4-connectivity.
    - Minimum-cut methods have practical applications in computer vision and image segmentation.

- **7 Combinatorial Search and Heuristic Methods**
  - **7.1 Backtracking**
    - Backtracking systematically iterates through all possible configurations of a solution space using depth-first search.
    - The search models solutions as vectors, extending partial solutions stepwise and pruning infeasible extensions.
    - Key application-specific routines include checking for solutions, generating candidates, processing solutions, and managing moves.
    - Detailed examples cover constructing all subsets, permutations, and simple paths in graphs.
    - For more on permutations and subsets, see Sections 14.4 and 14.5 of the referenced manual.
  - **7.2 Search Pruning**
    - Pruning cuts off search branches where partial solutions cannot yield valid complete solutions, greatly improving efficiency.
    - Symmetry exploitation, such as fixing the start vertex in TSP, reduces search redundancy.
    - Effective pruning is critical to solving problems of size typically ranging from 15 to 50 items.
  - **7.3 Sudoku**
    - Sudoku solving utilizes backtracking by selecting the next cell to fill and the possible numbers to assign, pruning impossible or invalid moves.
    - Selecting the most constrained empty square dramatically speeds up the search.
    - Implementations employ routines to find possible values, make moves, undo moves, and detect solutions.
    - Lookahead pruning identifies dead-ends earlier, substantially reducing search complexity.
    - Comparative results demonstrate that lookahead and constrained square selection reduce search steps by orders of magnitude.
  - **7.4 War Story: Covering Chessboards**
    - The problem analyzes placing eight main chess pieces to threaten all 64 board squares simultaneously.
    - Naive exhaustive search is infeasible, so pruning uses piece mobility limits and piece ordering by mobility.
    - Symmetry reductions and weak vs. strong threat definitions enable more efficient search.
    - Final analysis showed no arrangements covering all 64 squares with bishops on opposite colors, but seven pieces suffice when superimposing queen and knight.
    - See [RHS89] for deeper details on this classical combinatorial problem.
  - **7.5 Heuristic Search Methods**
    - Heuristics provide approximate solutions to intractable combinatorial optimization problems without enumerating the full solution space.
    - Three methods discussed are random sampling, local search (hill-climbing), and simulated annealing.
    - Random sampling uniformly selects random solutions but performs poorly when good solutions are rare or when solution space coherence exists.
    - Local search improves solutions by iterative local modifications but risks getting trapped in local optima.
    - Simulated annealing probabilistically accepts worse solutions to escape local optima and employs a cooling schedule to decrease randomness.
    - Comparative TSP experiments show simulated annealing outperforming both random sampling and local search in quality and convergence speed.
    - For more on heuristic algorithms and their applications, see [AL97] and [DT04].
    - Sample problems include maximum cut, maximum independent set, and circuit board placement with natural cost functions and transitions.
  - **7.6 War Story: Only it is Not a Radio**
    - Problem deals with selective assembly to maximize the number of functional multi-part devices with bounded total defect.
    - The problem maps to hypergraph matching (NP-complete) and constrained bin packing.
    - A simulated annealing heuristic moves/swaps parts across assemblies, scoring solutions by number of working assemblies plus proximity of others to defect limits.
    - This approach improved factory results by producing more working assemblies than previously achieved.
  - **7.7 War Story: Annealing Arrays**
    - Designing dense oligonucleotide arrays for DNA sequencing requires minimizing array size covering a given set of strings.
    - The solution models states as subsets of prefixes and suffixes and uses simulated annealing with moves like swap, add, delete, and usefulness-based operations.
    - The multi-term cost function balances array dimensions and string coverage to steer annealing towards smaller arrays.
    - The final optimized HIV 7-mer array was reduced from 192×192 to 130×132, computed in about fifteen minutes.
    - See [BS97] and [CGJ98] for further reading on array design and selective assembly.
  - **7.8 Other Heuristic Search Methods**
    - Methods like genetic algorithms, neural networks, and ant colony optimization also address combinatorial problems via nature-inspired analogies.
    - Genetic algorithms maintain populations and evolve solutions via crossover and mutation, but often perform worse and slower than simulated annealing in practice.
    - Practical implementations require careful consideration due to complexity and slow convergence.
    - The author recommends simulated annealing over genetic algorithms for heuristic optimization.
  - **7.9 Parallel Algorithms**
    - Parallel processing can speed up algorithm execution but often yields limited speedup compared to improving sequential algorithms.
    - Effective parallelization requires minimizing interprocessor communication and careful load balancing.
    - Debugging parallel programs is more challenging due to nondeterminism.
    - Naive parallelization of brute-force search may be inferior to optimized sequential algorithms.
    - For safe parallelization, partition workloads into independent subproblems when possible.
  - **7.10 War Story: Going Nowhere Fast**
    - Parallelization of Waring’s conjecture checking on a hypercube failed due to improper workload balancing.
    - Splitting input numeric intervals equally ignored variable computation times per integer.
    - Final processors running slow subranges stalled the entire computation.
    - Lesson: load balancing based on computational complexity is essential in parallel processing.
  - **7.11 Exercises**
    - Exercise topics cover backtracking implementations including derangements, multiset permutations, graph isomorphism, anagrams, subgraph isomorphism, and turnpike reconstruction.
    - Combinatorial optimization exercises include bandwidth minimization, maximum satisfiability, maximum clique, vertex and edge coloring, feedback vertex sets, and set cover problems.
    - Interview problems focus on permutations, subsets, anagrams, digit-to-letter mappings, and unique sequence enumerations.
    - Programming challenges listed from online judge platforms offer practice on related combinatorial problems.
    - Relevant external resources include [SR03], [AL97], and online judge archives for practice implementations.

- **14.1 Sorting**
  - **Input description**
    - The input is a set of n items to be arranged by order.
    - Sorting is fundamental for many algorithmic problems and is often the first design step.
  - **Problem description**
    - The problem consists of arranging items in increasing or decreasing order.
  - **Criteria for choosing sorting algorithms**
    - Different sorting algorithms suit varying data sizes, key uniqueness, and data properties.
    - Quadratic-time sorts like insertion sort are preferred for small datasets (n ≤ 100).
    - O(n lg n) algorithms (heapsort, quicksort, mergesort) are suited for larger datasets.
    - Stable sorting is necessary when preserving the relative order of equal keys.
    - Data knowledge (e.g., partial sorting, key distribution) can optimize sorting choice.
  - **External sorting considerations**
    - Massive data exceeding memory requires algorithms minimizing disk access.
    - Multiway mergesort and B-tree traversal are standard external sorting techniques.
  - **Implementation guidelines**
    - Quicksort is the best general-purpose internal sorting algorithm with tuning heuristics.
    - Recommended heuristics include randomization, median-of-three pivot selection, switching to insertion sort on small arrays, and processing smaller partitions first.
    - Practical programming favors library routines like GNU sort, C qsort, C++ STL sort, and Java Collections.
  - **Notes and references**
    - Knuth’s book remains the definitive reference on sorting.
    - Historical algorithms include heapsort (Williams), quicksort (Hoare), and mergesort (von Neumann).
    - High-performance sorting competitions and cache-aware and cache-oblivious designs have driven recent advances.
    - Sorting lower bound is Ω(n lg n) under the algebraic decision tree model.
    - Alternative computational models yield faster sorting algorithms.
    - See [Knuth’s Sorting Treatise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Art_of_Computer_Programming) and [GNU coreutils](http://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/) for further reading.

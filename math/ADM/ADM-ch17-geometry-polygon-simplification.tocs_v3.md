- **17.12 Simplifying Polygons**
  - **Problem Overview**
    - Simplification seeks a polygon or polyhedron p′ with fewer vertices that closely approximates the original polygon p.
    - Primary applications are noise reduction in scanned shapes and data compression in graphics rendering.
  - **Key Issues in Shape Simplification**
    - The convex hull provides the simplest simplification but removes concavities crucial for recognizing some shapes.
    - Simplification methods differ in whether they only delete vertices or also move/insert vertices for better approximations.
    - Maintaining a simple polygon without self-intersections is important to prevent artifacts; minimum-link path methods aid this.
    - Image noise can be reduced via Fourier transform filtering, distinct from polygon simplification methods.
  - **Douglas-Peucker Algorithm**
    - Starts with the simplest polygon (two vertices) and iteratively inserts the vertex farthest from the approximation edge.
    - Runs in O(kn) time for inserting k points in a polygon of n vertices.
    - Widely used basis for shape simplification, with efficient implementations available ([HS94]).
  - **Simplification in Three Dimensions**
    - Simplification becomes NP-complete for minimal-size surfaces separating two polyhedra.
    - Heuristic extensions of planar algorithms exist for polyhedral simplification.
  - **Additional Methods and Implementations**
    - Simplification envelopes generate level-of-detail hierarchies preserving holes and preventing self-intersections.
    - QSlim uses quadric-based simplification for rapid, high-quality surface approximations.
    - Medial-axis transform simplification trims polygon skeletons to yield simpler polygons; Cocone and Powercrust implement this for 3D.
    - CGAL supports extreme simplification like smallest enclosing circle/sphere calculations.
  - **Notes and Further Reading**
    - Douglas-Peucker underlies most schemes with optimizations from [HS94, HS98].
    - The link distance polygon simplification method is detailed in [GHMS93].
    - Shape simplification algorithms are surveyed in [HG97].
    - Medial-axis transformation approaches are discussed in [TH03].
    - Polygon simplicity testing can be performed in linear time via Chazelle’s triangulation algorithm [Cha91].

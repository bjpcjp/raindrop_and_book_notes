- **Shape Similarity**
  - **Input description**
    - The input consists of two polygonal shapes, P1 and P2.
    - The problem is to determine how similar the two shapes are.
  - **Problem description**
    - Shape similarity underlies many pattern recognition tasks, such as optical character recognition (OCR).
    - The goal is to identify unknown shapes by matching them against a library of known shape models.
    - Shape similarity is ill-defined because "similar" depends on the application context.
  - **Discussion**
    - No single algorithm can solve all shape-matching problems; extensive tuning is usually required.
    - Multiple approaches to shape similarity include:
      - **Hamming distance**
        - Measures the area difference between overlaid polygons (symmetric difference).
        - Requires proper alignment, simplified in applications like OCR without rotation.
        - Efficient on bit-mapped images but only captures a crude notion of shape.
        - Refer to polygon intersection and area computation techniques ([Section 17.8](page 591), [Section 17.1]).
      - **Hausdorff distance**
        - Measures the maximum distance from points on one shape to the closest points on the other.
        - Not symmetric and sensitive to protrusions; less impacted by small boundary noise.
        - Alignment remains a challenging and time-consuming task.
        - Optimal linear-time algorithms exist for convex polygons ([Ata83]) and general cases ([HK90]).
      - **Comparing skeletons**
        - Uses thinning algorithms to extract tree-like skeletons representing shape structure.
        - Compares topology and edge features via subgraph isomorphism methods ([Section 16.9](page 550)).
      - **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**
        - Learning-based methods that classify shapes based on extracted features (area, sides, holes).
        - Require significant data and tuning to achieve good performance.
        - Black-box classifiers may fail unexpectedly without interpretability.
        - Several implementations are available, including LIBSVM and SVMlight.
  - **Implementations**
    - A C implementation of Hausdorff-based comparison is available at Cornellâ€™s website.
    - Angle-turning function metric implementations are also provided online.
    - Major SVM libraries include Kernel-machine library, SVMlight, and LIBSVM.
  - **Notes**
    - General references on pattern classification include [DHS00, JD88].
    - Computational geometry-based approaches to shape similarity are surveyed in [AG00].
    - Optimal alignment algorithms for translation without rotation run in O((n + m) log(n + m)) time [dBDK+98].
    - Approximate algorithms exist for translation and rotation alignment [ACP+07].
  - **Related Problems**
    - Related problems addressed include graph isomorphism ([page 550]) and thinning ([page 598]).

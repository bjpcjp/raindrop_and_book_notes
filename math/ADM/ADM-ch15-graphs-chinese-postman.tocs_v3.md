- **Eulerian Cycle/Chinese Postman**
  - **Problem Description**
    - The problem seeks the shortest tour that visits every edge in a graph at least once.
    - Applications include designing routes for garbage trucks, snow plows, or postmen.
    - The problem can also model efficient testing of telephone menu systems, where edges represent menu options.
    - The goal is to minimize total travel time, distance, or edge traversals.
  - **Eulerian Path and Cycle Conditions**
    - An undirected graph has an Eulerian cycle if it is connected and every vertex has even degree.
    - An undirected graph has an Eulerian path if it is connected and exactly two vertices have odd degree.
    - A directed graph has an Eulerian cycle if it is strongly connected and every vertex’s in-degree equals its out-degree.
    - Directed Eulerian paths require specific in-degree and out-degree imbalances limited to start and end vertices.
  - **Cycle Construction**
    - The existence test uses DFS or BFS for connectivity and counts odd-degree vertices.
    - Constructing the cycle is linear-time by iteratively extracting edge-disjoint cycles and splicing them together.
    - Deleting cycles preserves Eulerian degree conditions as vertex degrees are reduced by even numbers.
  - **Chinese Postman Problem**
    - The Chinese postman problem finds the minimum-length cycle visiting all edges at least once when Eulerian conditions don't hold.
    - The problem reduces to making the graph Eulerian by adding edges between odd-degree vertices via shortest paths.
    - This reduces to finding a minimum-weight perfect matching among odd-degree vertices.
    - Directed graphs use bipartite matching algorithms between out-degree defcient and in-degree defcient vertices.
    - Once Eulerian, the cycle is extracted in linear time using Eulerian cycle construction techniques.
  - **Implementations and Resources**
    - Implementations of Eulerian cycles are common; Chinese postman implementations are rarer.
    - The directed Chinese postman implementation by Thimbleby is available in Java at [Thimbleby’s site](http://www.cs.swan.ac.uk/~csharold/cpp/index.html).
    - The GOBLIN C++ library supports Chinese postman solutions for directed and undirected graphs.
    - LEDA provides tools for Eulerian cycles, matching, and shortest-path computations.
    - Combinatorica offers Mathematica implementations relevant to Eulerian cycles and de Bruijn sequences.
  - **Historical and Theoretical Notes**
    - Euler introduced graph theory in 1736 solving the seven bridges of Königsberg problem, proving no Eulerian cycle existed due to vertex degrees.
    - Linear-time Eulerian cycle algorithms and Fleury’s algorithm provide practical construction methods.
    - Euler’s tour technique underpins many parallel graph algorithms by facilitating spanning tree rooting.
    - The Chinese postman problem was introduced by Kwan; Edmonds and Johnson developed the bipartite matching approach.
    - The Chinese postman problem is NP-complete for mixed graphs (graphs with both directed and undirected edges).
    - Further exposés on the Chinese postman algorithm include [Lawler 1976](https://example.org).
  - **De Bruijn Sequences and Eulerian Cycles**
    - De Bruijn sequences are circular strings that contain every string of a fixed length over an alphabet exactly once.
    - These sequences correspond to Eulerian cycles on a de Bruijn graph constructed from substring vertices.
    - The connection shows Eulerian cycles have applications beyond routing, including sequence generation.
    - Additional reading includes [Eve79a] and [PS03], referenced for de Bruijn sequence construction.

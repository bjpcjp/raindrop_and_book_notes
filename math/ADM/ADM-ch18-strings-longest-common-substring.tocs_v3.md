- **18.8 Longest Common Substring/Subsequence**  
  - Covers the problem of finding the longest string common as a substring or subsequence among multiple input strings.  
  - Discusses applications including biological sequence consensus and plagiarism detection.  
  - Differentiates between longest common substring (consecutive characters) and longest common subsequence (not necessarily consecutive).  
  - Describes algorithms for two strings, including dynamic programming and suffix trees.  
  - Explains optimizations for low-repetition or permutation strings using geometrical and sorting approaches.  
  - Notes the exponential complexity and NP-completeness for multiple string alignment and mentions heuristics.  
  - Lists software implementations for multiple sequence alignment, including ClustalW and MSA package.  
  - References advanced algorithms and literature such as Hunt and Szymanskiâ€™s method, bit-parallel algorithms, and the four Russians technique.  
  - Provides pointers to surveys, biological sequence alignment resources, and plagiarism detection implementations.  
  - Suggests related problems like approximate string matching and shortest common superstring.

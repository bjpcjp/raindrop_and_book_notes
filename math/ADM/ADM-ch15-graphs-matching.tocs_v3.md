- **Matching**
  - **Problem Description**
    - The problem seeks the largest set of edges in a graph so that each vertex is incident to at most one edge.
    - Common applications include assigning tasks to workers ensuring no worker is overloaded.
    - The problem is formalized as finding a maximum matching in a graph.
  - **Key Concepts**
    - Matching problems are often modeled on bipartite graphs for simplicity and efficiency.
    - Augmenting paths alternate edges in and out of the current matching to increase matching size.
    - Berge’s theorem states a matching is maximum if no augmenting paths exist.
    - Odd-length cycles called blossoms pose challenges in general, non-bipartite graphs.
  - **Algorithmic Approaches**
    - Bipartite matching commonly uses network flow transformations.
    - Weighted matchings apply matrix-oriented Hungarian algorithms.
    - The Hopcroft-Karp algorithm finds shortest augmenting paths in O(√n m) time.
    - Edmond’s algorithm and Gabow’s implementation address general graph matching with cubic time complexity.
  - **Applications and Examples**
    - Matching frameworks apply to worker-task assignments, marriage problems, and string permutation problems.
    - Stable matching guarantees existence and can be found in O(n²) time.
    - Medical resident-hospital assignments use stable matching algorithms.
  - **Software Implementations**
    - High-performance codes such as Goldberg’s CSA (weighted) and BIM (unweighted) exist.
    - The First DIMACS Implementation Challenge collected various matching solvers.
    - Libraries like GOBLIN and LEDA provide C++ implementations for weighted and unweighted matching.
    - Blossom IV offers efficient minimum-weight perfect matching in C.
  - **Theoretical Notes**
    - Lovász and Plummer [LP86] provide authoritative coverage on matching theory.
    - Matching size equals minimum vertex cover size in bipartite graphs.
    - Maximum matching, minimum vertex cover, and maximum independent set can be solved in polynomial time on bipartite graphs.
    - Stable marriage theory is well studied in [GI89] and found efficiently by Gale-Shapley [GS62].

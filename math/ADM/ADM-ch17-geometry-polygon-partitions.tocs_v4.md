- **Polygon Partitioning**
  - **Problem Description**
    - The goal is to partition a polygon or polyhedron into a small number of simple, typically convex, pieces.
    - Convex pieces simplify many geometric algorithms by making problems easier to handle than on nonconvex polygons.
    - Different partitioning problems depend on whether pieces must be triangles, allow overlapping covers, or permit adding extra vertices (Steiner points).
    - Triangulations divide polygons into n−2 triangles, which are the simplest convex polygons but not always minimal in piece count.
    - Refer to Section 17.3 for a detailed discussion of triangulation techniques.
  - **Partitioning Variants**
    - Partitioning divides the polygon interior into nonoverlapping pieces, whereas covering allows overlapping pieces.
    - Partitioning is preferred when unique point membership in pieces is required; covering may be used for tasks like painting.
    - Adding Steiner vertices inside the polygon or splitting edges can reduce the number of pieces but complicate algorithms.
  - **Heuristics and Algorithms**
    - The Hertel-Mehlhorn heuristic starts from any triangulation and deletes chords that preserve convexity, ensuring no internal angles over 180 degrees.
    - This heuristic guarantees at most four times the minimum number of convex pieces and runs efficiently.
    - Dynamic programming can find the minimal number of diagonals but runs in O(n^4) time in the simplest form.
    - Faster algorithms achieve O(n + r^2 min(r^2, n)) time, where r is the count of reflex vertices; some use interior vertices to reduce piece count further.
    - Decomposition into monotone polygons is another alternative, characterized by chains where horizontal lines intersect at most once.
  - **Implementations**
    - Many triangulation codes start by trapezoidal or monotone polygon decompositions.
    - CGAL provides libraries implementing the Hertel-Mehlhorn heuristic, optimal convex partitioning (O(n^4)), and monotone polygon partitioning (O(n log n)).
    - GEOMPACK is a suite of Fortran 77 codes supporting 2D and 3D triangulations and convex decompositions.

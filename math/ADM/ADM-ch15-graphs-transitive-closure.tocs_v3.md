- **15.5 Transitive Closure and Reduction**
  - **Input and Problem Description**
    - The input is a directed graph G = (V, E).
    - Transitive closure constructs graph G' with edge (i, j) if a directed path exists from i to j in G.
    - Transitive reduction produces a smaller graph G' retaining identical reachability as G.
    - Reachability queries become constant time after transitive closure via matrix entries.
  - **Algorithms for Transitive Closure**
    - Three main algorithms exist: repeated BFS/DFS, Warshall’s algorithm, and matrix multiplication.
    - BFS/DFS from each vertex yields O(n(n+m)) time, suitable for sparse graphs.
    - Warshall’s algorithm runs in O(n³) time and uses a bit matrix representation.
    - Matrix multiplication leverages fast exponentiation to compute closure in O(log n) matrix multiplications.
    - Strongly connected components reduce problem size and improve efficiency.

  - **Transitive Reduction**
    - Transitive reduction minimizes edges while preserving reachability.
    - It is the inverse operation of transitive closure with identical closure results.
    - Quick heuristic replaces strongly connected components by simple cycles to approximate minimal reduction.
    - Exact minimal reduction with only original edges is NP-complete due to Hamiltonian cycle relation.
    - O(n³) algorithms exist if arbitrary edges are allowed in the reduction.
    - Heuristic edge elimination checks if removing edge maintains reachability.

  - **Implementations and Resources**
    - Boost library provides efficient transitive closure algorithms based on [Nuu95].
    - LEDA offers C++ implementations for both transitive closure and reduction.
    - Java lacks standard libraries, but Graphlib Java Transitivity library supports both.
    - Mathematica’s Combinatorica package includes both operations with visualization tools.
    - Van Leeuwen [vL90a] surveys transitive closure and reduction comprehensively.

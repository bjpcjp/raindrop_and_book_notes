- **16.7 Vertex Coloring**
  - **Input description**
    - The input is a graph G = (V, E) for vertex coloring.
    - Each vertex represents an entity to be colored.
    - Edges indicate adjacency that forbids identical colors.
  - **Problem description**
    - Assign colors to vertices so adjacent vertices never share a color.
    - The objective is to minimize the number of colors used.
    - The minimal number of colors is called the graph's chromatic number.
  - **Discussion**
    - Vertex coloring applies in scheduling and compiler register allocation.
    - Variables with overlapping lifespans are connected to prevent same-color assignments.
    - The problem is NP-complete, requiring heuristics or backtracking for solutions.
  - **Special cases of interest**
    - Bipartite graphs can be colored with two colors using DFS in O(n + m) time.
    - Planar graphs can be colored with at most four colors, with a simple 6-color algorithm using low-degree vertex deletion.
    - Edge-coloring problems relate to vertex coloring and have efficient approximate algorithms.
  - **Incremental methods and heuristics**
    - Vertices are colored sequentially using heuristics like largest-degree first.
    - Brèlaz’s heuristic dynamically selects vertices based on the number of adjacent colors.
    - Color interchange can improve colorings by swapping colors in connected components, though it increases complexity.
  - **Implementations and resources**
    - Culberson’s and Trick’s webpages provide bibliographies and DSATUR algorithm codes.
    - DIMACS Implementation Challenge and GraphCol offer algorithms and heuristics.
    - Boost Graph Library and GOBLIN library provide implementations in C++.
    - Pascal, Fortran, and Mathematica implementations are available for backtracking and heuristics.
  - **Notes**
    - Classical heuristics include largest-first and smallest-last orderings.
    - The four-color theorem guarantees planar graphs are 4-colorable but NP-complete to test 3-colorability.
    - Brooks’ theorem bounds chromatic number by maximum vertex degree plus one.
    - Approximation algorithms exist but with limited guarantees, as vertex coloring is hard to approximate.
    - Key references include [Culberson’s graph coloring page](http://web.cs.ualberta.ca/~joe/Coloring/) and [Four-color theorem exposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_color_theorem).

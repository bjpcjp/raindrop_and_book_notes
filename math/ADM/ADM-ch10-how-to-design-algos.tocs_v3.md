- **How to Design Algorithms**
  - **Introduction**
    - Designing algorithms involves creative problem-solving and requires choosing among many design options.
    - Success requires both technical knowledge and a problem-solving mindset focused on inquiry and careful reasoning.
    - Maintaining a distinction between strategy (big picture) and tactics (details) is crucial throughout the design process.
    - The text emphasizes asking and answering guiding questions with documented reasoning to avoid overlooking possibilities.
    - The approach is inspired by disciplined problem-solving under pressure, exemplified by test pilots in [The Right Stuff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Right_Stuff_(book)).
  - **1. Do I really understand the problem?**
    - Clarify the exact nature of inputs and desired outputs.
    - Test understanding by solving small examples by hand.
    - Assess optimality requirements, problem size, speed needs, implementation constraints, and problem type.
  - **2. Can I find a simple algorithm or heuristic for my problem?**
    - Evaluate if brute force can solve the problem correctly and in reasonable time.
    - Analyze heuristic approaches based on simple rules, including their effectiveness on different input types and speed.
    - Verify the problem is well-defined with measurable solution quality.
  - **3. Is my problem in the catalog of algorithmic problems in the back of this book?**
    - Check known results and available implementations for the problem.
    - Search carefully using various keywords, images, indexes, and internet resources.
    - Utilize the book’s webpage [http://www.cs.sunysb.edu/~algorith](http://www.cs.sunysb.edu/~algorith) for additional sources.
  - **4. Are there special cases of the problem that I know how to solve?**
    - Identify simpler problem instances by ignoring parameters or setting values to trivial ones.
    - Seek efficient solutions to these special cases.
    - Analyze why special-case solutions might not generalize widely.
    - Determine if the problem itself is a special case of a more general known problem.
  - **5. Which of the standard algorithm design paradigms are most relevant to my problem?**
    - Consider sorting elements by key to simplify the problem.
    - Explore problem splitting via binary search or divide-and-conquer partitioning.
    - Apply dynamic programming where natural ordering exists in input or output.
    - Use appropriate data structures like hash tables or priority queues to optimize repeated operations.
    - Employ randomized algorithms such as random sampling, multiple random configurations, or simulated annealing.
    - Evaluate formulations as linear or integer programs.
    - Assess if the problem is NP-complete or related to well-known difficult problems, checking resources like Garey and Johnson [Computers and Intractability](https://dl.acm.org/doi/book/10.5555/58058).
  - **6. Am I still stumped?**
    - Consider hiring experts if feasible, referring to professional consulting resources.
    - Revisit earlier questions to update or refine answers and insights.
    - Emphasize problem-solving as partly art and skill, recommending George Pólya’s [How to Solve It](https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691164076/how-to-solve-it) as foundational reading.

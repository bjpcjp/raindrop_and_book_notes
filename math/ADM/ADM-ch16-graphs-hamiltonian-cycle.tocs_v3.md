- **16.5 Hamiltonian Cycle**
  - **Problem Description**
    - The task is to find a tour visiting each vertex exactly once using only edges from graph G.
    - Finding a Hamiltonian cycle is a special case of the traveling salesman problem with edge weights 1 for existing edges and 2 for non-edges.
    - Non-edge pairs have weighted distance 2, making a TSP tour cost n if and only if G is Hamiltonian.
  - **Related Problems and Complexity**
    - Longest path and cycle problems are NP-complete even on restrictive unweighted graphs.
    - The longest path is useful in pattern recognition where vertices represent symbols and edges represent adjacency.
  - **Solution Approaches**
    - Relaxing the constraint on vertex visits allows heuristics and approximation algorithms, such as DFS-based spanning tree tours.
    - Dynamic programming solves longest path in DAGs in linear time by converting min to max in shortest path algorithms.
    - Dense graphs with minimum vertex degree ≥ n/2 always contain Hamiltonian cycles, which can be constructed efficiently.
    - Verification is needed to differentiate Hamiltonian vertex tours from Eulerian edge tours.
  - **Backtracking and Pruning**
    - Backtracking with pruning is the only general exact solution for Hamiltonicity.
    - Bi-connectedness is a necessary condition; articulation points preclude Hamiltonian cycles.
  - **Implementations and Software**
    - Reducing Hamiltonian cycle to symmetric TSP obeying triangle inequality enables use of TSP solvers like Concorde.
    - Vandegriend's master's thesis offers an effective Hamiltonian cycle program.
    - Lodi and Punnen surveyed TSP and Hamiltonian cycle software [TSP software survey](http://www.or.deis.unibo.it/research_pages/tspsoft.html).
    - The Stanford GraphBase football program solves asymmetric longest-path problems using stratified greedy algorithms.
    - Nijenhuis and Wilf provide an efficient backtracking routine to enumerate all Hamiltonian cycles.
    - ACM Algorithm 595 is a Fortran exact/heuristic procedure controlling backtracking.
  - **Notes and Historical Context**
    - Hamiltonian cycles originated from Euler's knight's tour and Hamilton's 1839 game.
    - Common sufficiency conditions exist, e.g., West [Wes00] for graph Hamiltonicity.
    - Bio-computing approaches solved small instances but are infeasible beyond n≈70 due to exponential growth.
    - References include [ABCC07], [GP07], and [LLKS85] for traveling salesman and Hamiltonian cycle studies.
  - **Related Problems**
    - Eulerian cycle problems are related but tractable with fast algorithms.
    - Traveling salesman problem is the broader class including Hamiltonian cycle as a special case.

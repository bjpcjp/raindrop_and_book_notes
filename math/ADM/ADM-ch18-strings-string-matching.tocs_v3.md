- **18.3 String Matching**
  - **Input description**
    - The input consists of a text string t of length n and a pattern string p of length m.
    - The goal is to find the first or all instances of pattern p in the text t.
    - String matching is fundamental to almost all text-processing applications.
    - For detailed algorithm examples, see Section 2.5.3.
  - **Algorithm selection considerations**
    - Short patterns and infrequent queries allow the simple O(mn)-time search algorithm to suffice.
    - Longer texts and patterns benefit from worst-case linear time algorithms like Knuth-Morris-Pratt.
    - Boyer-Moore algorithm is more efficient for patterns longer than 5 characters and infrequent matches.
    - Multiple queries on the same text justify building data structures such as suffix trees or suffix arrays.
    - Searching many texts with the same patterns calls for automaton-based algorithms like Aho-Corasick.
  - **Special cases and extensions**
    - Approximate string matching handles texts or patterns containing spelling errors, discussed further in Section 18.4.
    - Regular expressions require constructing finite automata equivalent to the regex for matching.
    - Context-free grammars extend string matching into parsing, detailed in Section 8.6.
  - **Implementations and resources**
    - Strmat offers C implementations of KMP and Boyer-Moore algorithms ([Strmat](http://www.cs.ucdavis.edu/~gusfield/strmat.html)).
    - SPARE Parts provides C++ implementations for single and multiple pattern matching ([SPARE Parts](http://www.fastar.org/)).
    - GNU grep combines lazy-state deterministic matching with Boyer-Moore for fixed strings ([GNU grep](http://directory.fsf.org/project/grep/)).
    - Boost string algorithms offer C++ string routine implementations, including search ([Boost string algo](http://www.boost.org/doc/html/string_algo.html)).

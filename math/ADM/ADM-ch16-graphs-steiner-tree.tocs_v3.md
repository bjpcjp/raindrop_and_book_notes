- **Input and problem description**
  - The input is a graph \( G = (V, E) \) and a subset of vertices \( T \subseteq V \).
  - The problem is to find the smallest tree connecting all vertices in \( T \).
  - Steiner trees have applications in network design, VLSI circuit design, and other domains.
- **Distinguishing features and problem complexity**
  - The Steiner tree problem allows the use or construction of intermediate connection points to reduce cost.
  - It differs from the minimum spanning tree (MST) problem in that MST connects all vertices, Steiner tree only the subset \( T \).
  - The general Steiner tree problem is NP-hard, even under many restrictions.
- **Problem variations and constraints**
  - **Number of points to connect**
    - For two vertices, the Steiner tree is the shortest path between them.
    - For \( S = V \), the Steiner tree reduces to the MST of \( G \).
  - **Geometric vs graph input**
    - Geometric Steiner problems take points in the plane with unknown intermediate points.
    - Steiner points have degree exactly three with angles of 120° in Euclidean cases.
    - Rectilinear Steiner trees restrict edges to horizontal and vertical with angles multiples of 90°.
  - **Edge constraints**
    - Geometric wiring problems may limit edges to rectilinear paths.
    - Different angular and degree constraints apply in rectilinear Steiner trees.
- **Heuristics and approximation methods**
  - Constructing an MST on a graph weighted by distances between points yields a good heuristic.
  - The MST approximation ratio for Euclidean Steiner trees has a worst-case ratio of about 1.154 (3/2).
  - For rectilinear Steiner trees, the MST approximation ratio is always at least 2/3.
  - Refinements include inserting Steiner points when MST edges meet at angles less than 120°.
  - An alternative heuristic builds the tree by iteratively adding shortest paths between terminals.
- **Practical considerations and use cases**
  - Some applications justify exhaustive searches using backtracking or branch-and-bound.
  - Steiner points can represent evolutionary or classification branches in phylogenetic trees.
  - Different phylogenetic reconstruction algorithms exist with varying data and optimization criteria.
- **Implementations and software**
  - GeoSteiner solves Euclidean and rectilinear Steiner tree problems optimally for up to 10,000 points ([GeoSteiner](http://www.diku.dk/geosteiner/)).
  - FLUTE focuses on fast rectilinear Steiner trees with user-controlled tradeoffs ([FLUTE](http://home.eng.iastate.edu/~cnchu/flute.html)).
  - GOBLIN offers heuristics and search methods for Steiner trees in general graphs ([GOBLIN](http://www.math.uni-augsburg.de/~fremuth/goblin.html)).
  - PHYLIP and PAUP contain phylogenetic tree reconstruction algorithms for arbitrary distance matrices ([PHYLIP](http://evolution.genetics.washington.edu/phylip.html), [PAUP](http://paup.csit.fsu.edu/)).
- **Notes and historical context**
  - The Euclidean Steiner problem dates back to Fermat and was solved by Torricelli, with Steiner erroneously credited for the general problem.
  - The Gilbert-Pollak conjecture on the Steiner tree to MST ratio was proven by Du and Hwang.
  - Euclidean MST computations can be done in \( O(n \log n) \) time.
  - Polynomial-time approximation schemes (PTAS) and better approximation algorithms exist ([Arora 1998], [Robins and Zelikovsky 2005]).
  - The Steiner tree problem is hard for graphs and Euclidean/rectilinear metrics.
  - Soap film analogies provide physical interpretations of the Steiner tree problem ([Mie58]).

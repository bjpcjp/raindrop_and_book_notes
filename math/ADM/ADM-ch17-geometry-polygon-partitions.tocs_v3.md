- **Polygon Partitioning**
  - **Input description**
    - The input is a polygon or polyhedron denoted as P.
  - **Problem description**
    - The problem is to partition P into a small number of simple, typically convex, pieces.
    - Polygon partitioning simplifies geometric problems by working on convex objects instead of nonconvex ones.
  - **Flavors of polygon partitioning**
    - Triangulation partitions the polygon into exactly n − 2 triangles for an n-vertex polygon.
    - Partitioning divides the polygon interior into nonoverlapping pieces, while covering allows overlapping pieces.
    - Steiner vertices may or may not be allowed, affecting the number and complexity of pieces.
  - **Hertel-Mehlhorn heuristic**
    - Starts with an arbitrary triangulation and deletes chords that leave only convex pieces.
    - Deleting a chord is safe if it does not create an internal angle greater than 180 degrees.
    - Produces a convex partition with no more than four times the minimum number of pieces.
    - Recommended as a simple and efficient heuristic.
  - **Dynamic programming methods**
    - Exact minimum convex decomposition using diagonals runs in O(n^4) time for the simplest implementation.
    - Faster algorithms run in O(n + r^2 min(r^2, n)) time, where r is the number of reflex vertices.
    - A more complex O(n^3) algorithm uses interior vertices to reduce the number of pieces further.
  - **Monotone polygon decomposition**
    - Partitions polygons into y-monotone pieces, where any horizontal line intersects each chain at most once.
  - **Implementations**
    - Triangulation codes often start with trapezoidal or monotone decompositions.
    - CGAL offers libraries for Hertel-Mehlhorn heuristic, optimal convex partitioning, and monotone polygon partitioning.
    - GEOMPACK provides Fortran 77 codes for 2D and 3D triangulation and convex decomposition.

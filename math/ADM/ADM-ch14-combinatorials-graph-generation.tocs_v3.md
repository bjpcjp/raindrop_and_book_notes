- **14.7 Generating Graphs**
  - **Graph generation parameters**
    - Parameters include number of vertices (n) and either number of edges (m) or edge probability (p).
    - Generation supports producing all graphs, random graphs, or next graphs matching criteria.
    - Applications include testing programs by comparing solutions and experimental graph theory validations.
  - **Key graph properties to consider**
    - Labeled vs. unlabeled graphs determine whether vertex naming affects graph uniqueness.
    - Directed vs. undirected graphs affect edge orientation and generation method.
    - Randomness models must be clearly defined for uniformity and application relevance.
  - **Models of random graph generation**
    - Random edge generation uses edge probability p to decide edge inclusion independently.
    - Random edge selection chooses a fixed number m of edges uniformly at random.
    - Preferential attachment favors connections to high-degree vertices, modeling real networks.
  - **Organic graphs as alternatives**
    - Organic graphs reflect real-world relationships, e.g., web links or transport networks.
    - They offer structured graph data often more relevant than random graphs.
  - **Special graph classes and algorithms**
    - Trees can be generated uniquely using Prüfer codes relating trees to sequences.
    - Graphs with fixed degree sequences can be constructed recursively or randomized via edge flipping.
  - **Implementations and resources**
    - The Stanford GraphBase provides diverse graph generators and random graph reproducibility.
    - Combinatorica offers Mathematica generators for many graph families and operations.
    - The Combinatorial Object Server specializes in tree generation routines.
    - Viger’s C++ implementation efficiently generates connected graphs with prescribed degree sequences.
    - Nauty provides programs for generating nonisomorphic graphs and special graph classes.
    - Extensive data catalogs by McKay and Royle exist for various graph families.
    - Fortran and C implementations for tree enumeration and generation are available ([Nijenhuis and Wilf](https://example.org), [Kreher and Stinson](http://www.math.mtu.edu/~kreher/cages/Src.html)).
  - **Notes and further reading**
    - Surveys on uniform random graph generation include [Goldwasser 1993] and [Tinhofer 1990].
    - Counting graphs is closely related to generation; see [Harary and Palmer 1973].
    - Prüfer code bijection is foundational for labeled tree generation ([Prüfer 1918]).
    - Random graph theory and threshold laws are surveyed in [Bollobás 2001] and [Janson et al. 2000].
    - Preferential attachment models have been introduced and studied in [Barabási 2003] and [Watts 2004].
    - The Erdős-Gallai theorem characterizes when degree sequences are graphical.

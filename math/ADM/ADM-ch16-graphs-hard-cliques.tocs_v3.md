- **Clique Problem Overview**
  - **Problem Description**
    - The goal is to find the largest subset of vertices S such that every pair of vertices in S share an edge.
    - Cliques represent complete subgraphs where all vertices are mutually adjacent.
    - Real-world applications include detecting large groups of closely connected individuals or suspiciously similar tax returns.
  - **Computational Complexity and Challenges**
    - Finding a maximum clique is NP-complete and is hard to approximate within a factor of \(n^{1/2 - \epsilon}\).
    - Worst-case difficulty of finding large cliques makes heuristic or approximate methods necessary.
    - For theoretical foundations on complexity, see [Karp (1972)](section 9.3.3).

- **Algorithmic Approaches and Heuristics**
  - **Maximal Clique Heuristics**
    - A maximal clique is one that cannot be expanded by adding any adjacent vertex.
    - Sorting vertices by degree and greedily adding vertices adjacent to all clique members runs in \(O(n + m)\) time.
    - Introducing randomness in vertex ordering and multiple trials can improve clique size.
  - **Finding Large Dense Subgraphs**
    - Instead of strict cliques, one can seek large subgraphs with the minimum vertex degree \( \geq k \).
    - The largest such subgraph can be constructed by iteratively deleting vertices with degree less than \(k\).
    - This algorithm runs in \(O(n + m)\) time and can yield dense but not necessarily complete subgraphs.
  - **Algorithms for Planar Graphs**
    - Planar graphs have maximum clique size 4 due to planarity constraints.
    - Efficient algorithms check neighborhoods of low-degree vertices to identify small cliques (size 3 or 4).
    - This iterative vertex removal exploiting planar properties reduces the problem efficiently.
  - **Exact Clique-Finding via Backtracking**
    - Exhaustive search uses pruning based on adjacency to avoid exploring impossible cliques.
    - Upper bounds on clique size can be obtained from vertex degrees to reduce search space.
    - Removing vertices below certain degree thresholds accelerates the search.
    - Randomized heuristics such as simulated annealing may yield good solutions practically.

- **Implementations and Resources**
  - **Available Software and Challenges**
    - The Cliquer library provides exact branch-and-bound clique algorithms in C ([Cliquer](http://users.tkk.fi/~pat/cliquer.html)).
    - DIMACS Implementation Challenge produced various algorithms and datasets for clique and independent set problems, available via FTP from dimacs.rutgers.edu.
    - Other programs include dfmax.c and dmclique.c adopting greedy or branch-and-bound strategies.
  - **Additional Implementations**
    - Kreher and Stinson’s C programs offer branch-and-bound algorithms with effective lower bounds ([Kreher & Stinson](http://www.math.mtu.edu/~kreher/cages/Src.html)).
    - GOBLIN offers branch-and-bound algorithms capable of handling graphs up to 150–200 vertices ([GOBLIN](http://www.math.uni-augsburg.de/~fremuth/goblin.html)).
  - **Further Reading and Surveys**
    - Comprehensive surveys on maximum clique problems are available in Bomze et al. [BBPP99].

- **16.1 Clique**
  - **Input description**
    - The input is a graph \(G = (V, E)\) representing vertices and edges.
  - **Problem description**
    - The problem asks for the largest subset \(S \subseteq V\) where every pair \((x, y) \in S\) is connected by an edge.
    - This represents a clique or a complete subgraph in the graph.
  - **Discussion**
    - Cliques represent groups of closely connected vertices, such as social cliques in a high school friendship graph.
    - Identifying cliques can reveal clusters in related objects, with applications like detecting tax fraud by finding suspiciously similar tax forms.
    - Finding the maximum clique is NP-complete and hard to approximate within \(n^{1/2 - \epsilon}\).
  - **Approaches and heuristics**
    - Finding a maximal clique can be done by sorting vertices by degree and greedily adding vertices adjacent to all current clique members in \(O(n+m)\) time.
    - Large dense subgraphs are an alternative to cliques, found by repeatedly deleting vertices with degree less than \(k\) to generate high-degree subgraphs efficiently.
    - In planar graphs, cliques larger than four cannot exist; algorithms check low-degree vertices exhaustively for small cliques.
  - **Exact search methods**
    - Exhaustive backtracking searches all vertex subsets, pruning early when adjacency fails.
    - Upper bounds on clique size come from vertex degrees and ordering; vertices unlikely to be in the max clique are deleted first.
    - Randomized heuristics like simulated annealing can find large cliques efficiently.
  - **Implementations**
    - Cliquer: A C library for weighted graphs using branch-and-bound, available at [Cliquer](http://users.tkk.fi/~pat/cliquer.html).
    - Source codes from the DIMACS challenge implement branch-and-bound and greedy algorithms.
    - Kreher and Stinson offer C branch-and-bound programs for maximum clique finding.
    - GOBLIN provides algorithms for large cliques on graphs up to 150-200 vertices.
  - **Notes**
    - Bomze et al. provide a comprehensive survey on maximum cliques.
    - The NP-completeness proof is by Karp, relating clique to vertex cover and independent set problems.
    - The densest subgraph problem seeks subsets with highest average degree, solvable approximately by deleting low-degree vertices.
    - Clique hardness of approximation is demonstrated under standard complexity assumptions.

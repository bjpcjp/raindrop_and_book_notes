- **Graph Data Structures**
  - **Basic Representations**
    - The two fundamental graph representations are adjacency matrices and adjacency lists.
    - Adjacency lists are generally preferred for most applications due to flexibility and efficiency.
    - The choice depends on graph size, density, algorithms used, and whether the graph is dynamic.
    - See [Section 5.2](page 151) for detailed explanations and C implementations of adjacency lists.
  - **Choosing Data Structures**
    - Graph size and density heavily influence the suitability of adjacency matrices versus lists.
    - Dense graphs justify adjacency matrices despite their quadratic space usage.
    - Algorithms like all-pairs shortest path suit adjacency matrices, while DFS favors adjacency lists.
    - Static graphs benefit from space-saving packed arrays in adjacency lists.
  - **Special Graph Types**
    - Planar graphs have at most 3nâˆ’6 edges and should be represented with adjacency lists.
    - Planar embeddings are best represented geometrically, with algorithms detailed in [Section 15.12](page 520).
    - Hypergraphs generalize edges to connect multiple vertices, represented by incidence matrices or bipartite incidence structures.
  - **Large and Hierarchical Graphs**
    - Very large graphs require lean representations, such as bit vector-packed matrices or pointer-eliminating adjacency lists.
    - Hierarchical decomposition clusters vertices into compressed subgraphs for scalable management.
    - Natural decompositions are preferable over heuristic graph partition algorithms for large graphs.
  - **Implementations and Libraries**
    - LEDA provides a comprehensive commercial graph library in C++.
    - The Boost Graph Library offers generic C++ graph data structures and algorithms.
    - JUNG, JDSL, and JGraphT are notable Java graph libraries with varied focuses and licenses.
    - The Stanford Graphbase offers a flexible CWEB implementation useful for study.
  - **Notes and Further Issues**
    - Adjacency lists gained prominence with linear-time algorithms by Hopcroft and Tarjan.
    - Compact static graph representations yield significantly improved algorithm performance.
    - Bit-minimization of graph representations and dynamic graph algorithms are active research areas.
    - Hierarchically-defined graphs appear commonly in VLSI design with specialized algorithms available.

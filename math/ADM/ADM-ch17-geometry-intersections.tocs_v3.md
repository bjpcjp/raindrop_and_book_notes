- **17.8 Intersection Detection**
  - **Input Description**
    - The input consists of a set S of lines and line segments or a pair of polygons/polyhedra.
    - The goal is to identify which line segment pairs intersect or find the intersection of two polygons or polyhedra.
    - Intersection detection is critical for applications requiring immediate identification of intersections, such as virtual-reality simulations.
  - **Applications and Issues**
    - Intersection detection prevents unrealistic scenarios in virtual reality, like passing through walls.
    - Important in VLSI design-rule checking to detect errors such as crossing metal strips before fabrication.
    - Several factors influence algorithms: detection versus computation, types of intersecting objects, and expected number of intersections.
  - **Algorithmic Considerations**
    - Detecting intersection existence is often simpler than computing exact intersection points.
    - Intersecting lines differ from line segments; lines intersect at one point, whereas segment intersection is more complex.
    - Output-sensitive algorithms run in O(n log n + k) time, where k is the number of intersections, often using planar sweepline techniques.
  - **Special Cases and Extensions**
    - Visibility queries translate to line segment intersection problems.
    - Intersection of convex polygons runs in O(n + m) time and is simpler than for nonconvex polygons, which may yield disconnected, complex intersections.
    - Polyhedra intersection is complicated as they can intersect without edge intersections.
  - **Repeated Intersection Searches and Optimizations**
    - In scenarios with static scenes and moving objects, bounding simpler enclosing objects like boxes improve efficiency.
    - Intersection checks first test these bounding boxes before detailed geometric checks.
  - **Planar Sweep Algorithm**
    - Sweeping a vertical line from left to right manages events: insertion, deletion, and intersection of segments.
    - An event queue (priority queue) and horizon data structure (balanced tree) manage the sweep line status.
    - Convex polygon intersections simplify sweepline implementation, requiring fewer data structure needs.
  - **Implementations and Software**
    - Libraries such as LEDA and CGAL implement the Bentley-Ottmann algorithm for line segment intersection in O((n + k) log n) time.
    - Robust C programs exist for convex polygon intersection as documented by Oâ€™Rourke.
    - Collision detection libraries like SWIFT++ efficiently detect intersections and distances among polyhedral models.
    - Qhull software computes mutual intersections of half-spaces and convex hulls in general dimensions.
  - **Additional Notes and References**
    - Mount provides a comprehensive survey on intersection algorithms.
    - Foundational texts include [dBvKOS00](#), [CLRS01](#), [PS85](#), with special cases like rectangle intersections detailed by Preparata and Shamos.
    - Optimal O(n log n + k) algorithms by Chazelle and Edelsbrunner exist, with simpler randomized approaches covered by Mulmuley.
    - Lin and Manocha survey collision detection techniques and software.
  - **Related Problems**
    - Intersection detection relates closely to maintaining arrangements and motion planning.

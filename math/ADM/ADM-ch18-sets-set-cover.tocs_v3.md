- **Set Cover**
  - **Input description**
    - The input consists of a collection of subsets \( S = \{S_1, \ldots, S_m\} \) of the universal set \( U = \{1, \ldots, n\} \).
  - **Problem description**
    - The goal is to find the smallest subset \( T \subseteq S \) whose union equals the universal set \( U \).
  - **Discussion and applications**
    - Set cover models problems such as acquiring items packaged in fixed lots and optimizing Lotto ticket purchases.
    - Boolean logic minimization can be formulated as a set cover problem by seeking the smallest disjunctive normal form formula.
    - Variations include set packing, vertex cover, and hitting set problems, which have specialized conditions and relationships.
    - Vertex cover is a special case of set cover, where edges are the universe and vertices correspond to subsets.
  - **Computational complexity and approximation**
    - Set cover is NP-complete and generally harder than vertex cover.
    - The greedy heuristic achieves an approximation no worse than \(\ln n\) times the optimum.
    - The greedy approach selects the subset covering the largest number of uncovered elements iteratively until all are covered.
  - **Algorithmic strategies**
    - Implementations can achieve \(O(S)\) time complexity using efficient data structures like priority queues.
    - Identifying elements that appear in only one subset helps optimize early selections.
    - Simulated annealing and backtracking can improve or ensure optimal but at higher computational cost.
  - **Integer programming formulation**
    - Set cover can be formulated as an integer program with 0-1 variables indicating subset selection.
    - Constraints ensure every universal set element is covered by at least one selected subset.
    - Relaxing to a linear program allows heuristic rounding solutions.
  - **Implementations and references**
    - Existing Pascal implementations and integer programming solvers like SYMPHONY can handle set cover and related problems.
    - Surveys and computational studies include [BP76], [Pas97], and [CFT99, CFT00].
    - Classic and modern analysis of the greedy heuristic found in [CLRS01] and [Hoc96].
    - Hardness of approximation results from [Fei98] demonstrate greedy heuristic limitations in theory.
  - **Related problems**
    - Closely related problems include matching, vertex cover, and set packing.

- **Text Compression**
  - **Input description**
    - The input is a text string S that must be compressed.
    - The goal is to create a shorter string S' from which S can be exactly reconstructed.
    - Compression addresses limitations of secondary storage and network bandwidth.

  - **Problem description**
    - Data compression aims to find space-efficient encodings for files.
    - The rise of networks increased the importance of reducing transmission bits.
    - Compression methods range from ad hoc to general algorithms.

  - **Issues in selecting a compression algorithm**
    - **Lossy vs. Lossless encoding**
      - Lossless encodings are needed for document storage to ensure fidelity.
      - Lossy compression sacrifices exact recovery but achieves higher compression.
      - Lossy methods suit images, video, and audio where minor artifacts are imperceptible.

    - **Data simplification before compression**
      - Preprocessing such as removing whitespace or formatting can improve compression.
      - The Burrows-Wheeler transform rearranges input to increase compressibility.
      - It sorts cyclic shifts and uses the last character of each sorted shift.
      - The transform is reversible and yields 10â€“15% better compression often.

    - **Patent considerations**
      - Some algorithms like LZW were patented but may now be expired.
      - Selecting non-patented variants often yields comparable performance.
      - Legal status influences algorithm adoption.
    - **Compressing image data**
      - Run-length encoding is a simple lossless method for images with large uniform regions.
      - Its effectiveness depends on bit allocation and image traversal order.
      - For advanced media, standards like JPEG and MPEG are recommended.

    - **Real-time compression requirements**
      - Decompression speed often outweighs compression speed in importance.
      - Systems like operating systems require fast, symmetric compression/decompression.
      - Streaming applications prioritize rapid decoding.
  - **Text compression algorithm classes**
    - **Static algorithms (Huffman codes)**
      - Huffman codes assign variable-length codes based on symbol frequency.
      - The code tree is built using a greedy algorithm in O(n log n) time.
      - They require two passes: one to build codes and another to encode.
      - Disadvantages include storing code tables and limited redundancy exploitation.
      - Further reading: [Huffman coding](https://example.org)
    - **Adaptive algorithms (Lempel-Ziv)**
      - Lempel-Ziv builds coding tables dynamically as text is read.
      - It adapts to local character distributions and encodes frequent substrings.
      - Encoders and decoders stay synchronized via clever protocols.
      - It is highly robust across data types and generally hard to outperform.

  - **Implementations**
    - gzip is a popular Lempel-Ziv variant under GNU license.
    - bzip2 uses the Burrows-Wheeler transform and offers tighter compression at the cost of speed.
    - High-compression algorithms expend significant run-time for marginal gains.

  - **Notes and research**
    - Key texts include Sayood [Say05], Salomon [Sal06], and Bell, Cleary, and Witten [BCW90].
    - Surveys and foundational papers are available for Huffman, Lempel-Ziv, and Burrows-Wheeler.
    - The IEEE Data Compression Conference is the premier research venue.

    - Connections exist to shortest common superstring problems.
    - Cryptography shares conceptual overlaps with data compression techniques.

- **15.11 Drawing Trees**
  - **Input description**
    - The input is a tree T, defined as a graph with no cycles.
  - **Problem description**
    - The goal is to produce a visually pleasing drawing of the given tree T.
  - **Discussion**
    - Tree drawing applications vary by use, including family trees, syntax trees, and phylogenetic trees.
    - Differences arise between drawing free trees and rooted trees, impacting layout and interpretation.
    - Rooted trees reflect hierarchical order radiating from a designated root node.
    - Free trees lack roots and hierarchical structure, suitable for MST visualizations or spatial embeddings.
  - **Drawing properties and algorithms**
    - Trees are planar and can be drawn without edge crossings.
    - General planar drawing algorithms exist but simpler specialized algorithms suffice for trees.
    - Spring-embedding heuristics work well for free trees but may be slow for some applications.
    - Rooted trees can be drawn using ranked or radial embeddings after selecting a root or tree center.
  - **Root selection and tree center**
    - Selecting a tree center (one or two adjacent vertices minimizing maximum distance) improves drawings.
    - The center can be found by repeatedly pruning leaves until one or two vertices remain.
  - **Ranked embeddings**
    - Place root at top center, divide page into strips for each subtree.
    - Draw each subtree recursively by positioning child roots centered in their strips.
    - Suitable for hierarchical data like family or corporate structures.
    - Narrow strips and cramped vertices can arise with deep recursion; strip widths should adapt to subtree sizes.
  - **Radial embeddings**
    - Place root or center at drawing center with angular sectors for subtrees.
    - Radial drawings better use space and visually reflect distance from center via concentric circles.
    - Especially suitable for free trees without inherent hierarchy.
  - **Implementations and software**
    - GraphViz is a popular, well-supported tool for graph and tree drawing using splines.
    - Commercial products include Tom Sawyer Software, yFiles, and iLOG’s JViews, all offering trials.
    - Mathematica’s Combinatorica provides implementations of rooted and radial tree layout algorithms.
  - **Additional resources and notes**
    - Comprehensive coverage available in the forthcoming Handbook of Graph Drawing and Visualization.
    - Notable books include those by Battista et al., Kaufmann and Wagner, and Jünger and Mutzel.
    - Heuristics and complexity results are discussed in research references such as [RT81], [Moe90], and [BJL06].
    - Related tree layouts like Van Emde Boas improve external memory performance.
    - See also sections "Drawing graphs" (page 513) and "Planar drawings" (page 520) for connected topics.

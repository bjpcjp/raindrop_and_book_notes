- **Drawing Trees**
  - **Input description**
    - The input is a tree T, a graph without any cycles.
    - Trees are always planar graphs and should be drawn so edges do not cross.
    - Tree drawing applications include file system hierarchies, family trees, syntax trees, and evolutionary trees.
  - **Problem description**
    - The task is to create a nice drawing of the tree T.
    - Different aesthetics depend on whether the tree is free or rooted.
  - **Discussion**
    - Rooted trees define a hierarchy from a single root node, influencing the drawing order of children.
    - Free trees lack a root and hierarchical order; their drawing must respect connection topology.
    - Selecting a center vertex or a root is crucial for producing natural drawings.
    - The tree center either consists of one vertex or two adjacent vertices and can be found in linear time.
  - **Drawing methods**
    - Ranked embeddings place the root at the top center, partitioning the page into vertical strips for subtrees.
    - Ranked embeddings illustrate hierarchy depth but may produce narrow strips, potentially cramping nodes.
    - Radial embeddings place the root/center in the middle, dividing space into angular sectors for subtrees.
    - Radial embeddings use space more efficiently and better suit free trees.
  - **Implementations**
    - GraphViz is a popular open-source graph drawing program supporting spline edges and large graphs.
    - Commercial products such as Tom Sawyer Software, yFiles, and iLOGâ€™s JViews offer advanced tree drawing features.
    - Combinatorica provides Mathematica implementations of tree drawing algorithms.
  - **Notes**
    - Tree drawing is well-studied, with surveys and books documenting various algorithms.
    - The problem can be NP-complete under certain aesthetic criteria.
    - Specialized tree layouts, such as Van Emde Boas layouts, improve external memory performance.
  - **Related Problems**
    - Tree drawing relates closely to drawing graphs and planar drawings.

- **Preface**
  - **Principle: Use Real Code, Not Pseudocode**
    - Pseudocode commonly found in textbooks is not sufficient for direct software implementation.
    - The book provides fully implemented, documented, and tested real code for algorithms.
    - Readers are encouraged to use or adapt the provided code in their own software.
    - Further reading: [Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Fulkerson)
  - **Principle: Separate the Algorithm from the Problem Being Solved**
    - Implementation separates generic algorithms from problem-specific details using well-defined interfaces.
    - Code readability and maintainability improve by encapsulating domain-specific elements.
    - Optimization is discouraged until correctness is established; premature optimization is warned against.

- **Part I: I**
  - **Chapter 1. Algorithms Matter**
    - **Section 1.1. Understand the Problem**
      - Real-world memory leak detection was inefficient due to improper data structure choice.
      - Knowing the correct structure and balancing it (red-black tree) dramatically improved performance.
      - Performance analysis must consider how data structures affect runtime.
      - Further reading: [Red-Black Trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red%E2%80%93black_tree)
    - **Section 1.2. Experiment if Necessary**
      - Experiments demonstrated performance depended on simultaneous open allocations rather than total leaks.
      - Instrumentation and testing reveal underlying algorithmic bottlenecks.
      - Conceptual insight leads to better algorithmic design choices.
    - **Section 1.3. Side Story**
      - Memory allocation performance varies depending on allocation sizes and order of deallocation.
      - Underlying system implementations may use complex, platform-dependent algorithms.
      - Empirical benchmarking validates claims about algorithmic behavior.

    - **Section 1.4. The Moral of the Story**
      - Choosing the right algorithm is a critical software development skill.
      - Algorithms need not be perfect, but must be suitable and effective.

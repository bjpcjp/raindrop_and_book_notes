- **Exterior Tensor Powers**
  - **Definition of alternating and skew-symmetric multilinear maps**
    - Alternating maps vanish when two adjacent arguments are identical; skew-symmetric maps satisfy sign-based permutation conditions.
    - Every linear map is alternating for n=1 by agreement.
    - The field characteristic affects equivalence between alternating and skew-symmetric maps.
    - See [Linear Algebra Done Right](https://linear.axler.net/) for an introduction to multilinear algebra.
  - **Properties of alternating multilinear maps**
    - Alternating maps change sign upon swapping adjacent arguments.
    - For fields with characteristic ≠ 2, skew-symmetric equals alternating.
    - The vector space of alternating multilinear maps is denoted Altⁿ(E; F).
  - **Definition and construction of the n-th exterior tensor power**
    - Constructed via quotient of tensor powers by the ideal generated by tensors u⊗u.
    - The universal mapping property characterizes exterior powers.
    - Exterior power (Λⁿ(E)) is generated by simple tensors u₁ ∧ ... ∧ uₙ.
  - **Functorial properties and isomorphisms of exterior powers**
    - For any linear map f: E → E′, there is induced f∧: Λⁿ(E) → Λⁿ(E′).
    - Exterior powers satisfy behavior under compositions of linear maps.
    - Hom(Λⁿ(E), F) ≅ Altⁿ(E; F) canonically.
- **Bases of Exterior Powers**
  - **Construction of bases for Λⁿ(E)**
    - Bases formed by wedge products u_I of basis vectors u_i indexed by increasing subsets I.
    - The dimension of Λⁿ(E) equals the binomial coefficient C(dim(E), n) when finite dimensional.
    - Vectors u₁∧...∧uₙ ≠ 0 if and only if the u_i are linearly independent.
  - **Linear independence and spanning of basis elements**
    - Plücker coordinates relate to linear independence conditions.
    - Example for n=2, dim(E)=3 uses triples e₁∧e₂, e₁∧e₃, e₂∧e₃ as a basis for Λ²(E).

- **Some Useful Isomorphisms for Exterior Powers**
  - **Direct sum decomposition isomorphism**
    - Λⁿ(E ⊕ F) ≅ ⊕_{k=0}^n Λ^k(E) ⊗ Λ^{n-k}(F).
    - This isomorphism respects grading and multilinear structure.
  - **Relation with tensor products helps manipulate complex tensors**
- **Duality for Exterior Powers**
  - **Nondegenerate pairing between Λⁿ(E*) and Λⁿ(E)**
    - Pairing defined by determinant of evaluation of dual vectors on vectors.
    - Canonical isomorphisms: (Λⁿ(E))^* ≅ Λⁿ(E^*) and Λⁿ(E^*) ≅ Altⁿ(E; K).
  - **Natural functorial behavior under linear maps**
    - Transpose maps induce pullbacks on exterior powers of duals.
  - **Hodge-type isomorphisms depend on choice of basis and are independent of orthonormal basis used**

    - Equations of the form ∑ ϵ_{i,J,H} λ_{H∪{i}} λ_{J−{i}} = 0 must hold for all index subsets.

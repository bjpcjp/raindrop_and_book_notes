- **29.1 Bilinear Forms**
  - Defines bilinear forms as pairings linear in each argument over any field K, including characteristic 2.
  - Establishes the association between symmetric bilinear forms and quadratic forms when characteristic is not 2.
  - Describes alternating and skew-symmetric bilinear forms and their equivalence in characteristic ≠ 2.
  - Introduces nondegeneracy, dual maps \( l_\varphi \) and \( r_\varphi \), and conditions for injectivity and isomorphisms with finite dimension.

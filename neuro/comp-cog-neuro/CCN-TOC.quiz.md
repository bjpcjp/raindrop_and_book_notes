1. **Q:** How does the book integrate biological details of neurons with computational models to explain neuron activation and learning?
   **A:** The book details neuron biology, including excitation, inhibition, and leak currents, and formulates mathematical models to compute neuron inputs and outputs, linking them to activation functions. It further discusses synaptic plasticity mechanisms such as Hebbian learning, Spike Timing Dependent Plasticity, and the eXtended Contrastive Attractor Learning (XCAL) model, combining biological realism with computational formulations to explain how neurons detect inputs and adapt through learning.

2. **Q:** What is the role of the neocortex's layered structure and connectivity patterns in supporting distributed representations and attractor dynamics, as explained in the text?
   **A:** The neocortex's layered arrangement and specific connectivity patterns enable neurons to form distributed representations through coarse and localist coding schemes. These patterns support bidirectional excitatory interactions fostering attractor dynamics, which help stabilize activity patterns and underlie categorization. Inhibitory interneurons regulate activity through feedforward and feedback inhibition, enabling competitive dynamics essential for functionally selective representations.

3. **Q:** How does the book describe the integration of self-organizing and error-driven learning within the Leabra framework and what are its biological underpinnings?
   **A:** The Leabra framework combines self-organizing learning, based on long-term synaptic modifications like the BCM model, and error-driven learning through short-term floating thresholds (XCAL), reflecting synaptic plasticity mechanisms. This integration allows networks to develop robust representations by balancing exploratory plasticity and goal-oriented adjustments, rooted in biological synaptic dynamics including NMDA receptor functions and temporal credit assignment mechanisms.

4. **Q:** In what ways does the text relate major brain areas such as the basal ganglia, hippocampus, and prefrontal cortex to their computational roles in motor control, memory, and executive function?
   **A:** The basal ganglia are described as critical for action selection and reinforcement learning, interfacing with dopamine-based temporal difference learning models. The hippocampus facilitates episodic memory through pattern separation and completion, supporting memory consolidation and spatial processing. The prefrontal cortex, together with basal ganglia and dopamine, enables robust active maintenance and dynamic gating in executive function, contributing to top-down cognitive control and hierarchical goal management.
   **External example:** The role of basal ganglia and hippocampus in learning and memory is detailed in this comprehensive review: https://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(18)30087-8

5. **Q:** How does the book explain perception and attention mechanisms in the brain, especially distinguishing the 'what' and 'where' pathways?
   **A:** Perception is explained through oriented edge detectors in the primary visual cortex for feature extraction. The 'what' pathway supports invariant object recognition via temporal cortex areas, while the 'where/how' pathway involving parietal regions manages spatial attention and neglect. Hemispatial neglect and Posner spatial cueing paradigms are used to illustrate dysfunction and attentional shifts, showing how these pathways interact to guide perception and action.

6. **Q:** What learning and memory principles, including catastrophic interference and complementary learning systems, are elucidated in relation to the hippocampus and neocortex?
   **A:** The book describes how the hippocampus enables pattern separation to minimize overlap, preventing catastrophic interference during episodic memory encoding. Complementary learning systems theory outlines how the hippocampus rapidly encodes episodic information, while slow learning in the neocortex consolidates memories over time. This dual system supports recognition memory, consolidation, and priming via weight- and activation-based mechanisms.

7. **Q:** How are language functions modeled biologically and computationally in the text, including reading, spelling-sound mappings, semantics, and syntax?
   **A:** Language modeling integrates articulatory phonology with computational frameworks like the triangle model for reading and dyslexia and latent semantic analysis for word co-occurrence. Syntax and semantics are addressed via the Sentence Gestalt model, which captures sentence-level comprehension. These models link brain regions responsible for language to cognitive functions through biologically plausible learning and representation mechanisms.

8. **Q:** Describe the computational models of executive function presented, focusing on PFC/Basal Ganglia interactions, dopamineâ€™s role, and cognitive control tasks.
   **A:** Executive function models emphasize robust active maintenance in PFC facilitated by basal ganglia dynamic gating, modulated by phasic dopamine signals supporting temporal credit assignment. Computational models like PBWM implement these dynamics, enabling flexible updating and output gating. Cognitive control is exemplified through models of tasks such as Stroop and N-back, illustrating hierarchical organization and affective influences of OFC and ACC on goal-directed behavior.

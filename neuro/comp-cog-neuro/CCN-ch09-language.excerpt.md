Language processing involves multiple brain areas and domain-general cognitive mechanisms, integrating perception, motor control, memory, and executive function to manage symbols, syntax, and complex semantic information. Models such as the triangle model of reading and the Sentence Gestalt model illustrate how language comprehension and production rely on interactions between orthography, phonology, semantics, and syntax within distributed neural networks.

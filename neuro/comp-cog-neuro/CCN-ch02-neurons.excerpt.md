Neurons function as detectors by integrating excitatory, inhibitory, and leak inputs to determine if the combined signal exceeds a threshold, triggering discrete action potential spikes or graded rate-coded outputs that communicate information efficiently. This integration process, grounded in both biological electrophysiology and Bayesian optimal detection principles, underlies neuronal plasticity and computation essential for perception, cognition, and memory.

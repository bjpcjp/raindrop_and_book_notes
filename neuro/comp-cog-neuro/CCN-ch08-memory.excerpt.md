The hippocampus plays a critical role in episodic memory by rapidly encoding distinct, sparse neural representations that minimize interference, enabling both pattern separation for novel memory encoding and pattern completion for recall. Complementary to this, the neocortex supports slow, overlapping learning that integrates semantic knowledge, with memory consolidation processes transferring information from hippocampus to cortex over time.

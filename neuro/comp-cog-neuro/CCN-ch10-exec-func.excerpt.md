The prefrontal cortex (PFC) serves as the brainâ€™s executive by actively maintaining and flexibly updating goal-relevant information through sustained neural firing, with the basal ganglia (BG) dynamically gating this activity under the influence of phasic dopamine signals that train gating based on reward prediction. This PFC-BG-dopamine system enables top-down cognitive control, integrating affective information from medial and ventral PFC regions to guide adaptive, goal-directed behavior across complex cognitive tasks.

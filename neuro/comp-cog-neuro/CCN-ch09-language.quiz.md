1. **Q:** How does the triangle model of reading explain the different types of acquired dyslexia and what are the functional roles of the orthography, phonology, and semantics pathways in this model?  
   **A:** The triangle model involves three main pathways: orthography (visual perception of written words), phonology (spoken motor output of word sounds), and semantics (word meaning). Phonological dyslexia results from damage to the direct orthography-to-phonology pathway, causing difficulty reading nonwords. Deep dyslexia involves more severe damage to the direct pathway, leading to semantic substitutions (e.g., "orchestra" read as "symphony") and visual errors because reading relies increasingly on semantics without the direct constraint. Surface dyslexia results from impaired access to semantics, meaning nonword reading is intact but exception words are mispronounced, showing the semantic pathway's role in memorizing irregular pronunciations.

2. **Q:** In what ways does the object recognition model from perception contribute to the spelling-to-sound mapping in the detailed reading model discussed, and why is spatial invariance important in this context?  
   **A:** The object recognition model forms increasingly complex feature combinations through successive hierarchical processing levels, developing spatial invariance, meaning it recognizes letters and letter groups regardless of their spatial position in the word. This spatial invariance is critical for reading since words can appear in different positions but letters maintain their identity. The model uses this property to create invariant representations of letters and letter clusters to support accurate spelling-to-sound mappings, enabling generalization to nonwords and capturing the context-sensitive and subregular nature of English orthography.

3. **Q:** Describe the biological basis and functional distinctions between Broca’s area and Wernicke’s area in language processing as explained in the text.  
   **A:** Broca’s area (ventral posterior frontal cortex, Brodmann areas 44 and 45), adjacent to mouth motor control regions, is involved in motor sequencing essential for producing fluid speech and also plays a role in syntactic processing even during comprehension, linking it to frontal cortex functions of managing complex behavior sequencing. Damage produces expressive aphasia with impaired syntax but intact semantics. Wernicke’s area (temporal cortex) is associated with semantic processing of language. Damage causes receptive aphasia characterized by fluent but nonsensical speech and impaired comprehension. The anatomical locations correspond to syntactic (frontal) versus semantic (temporal) processing specialization.  
   **External example:** Functional MRI studies confirm Broca’s area involvement in syntax and motor planning, and Wernicke’s in semantics: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4888106/

4. **Q:** How does Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) model semantic knowledge of words, and what is the key mathematical technique it employs to overcome the problems of word co-occurrence variability?  
   **A:** LSA models semantics by analyzing statistics of word co-occurrence within semantically relevant text chunks, capturing indirect semantic relationships where synonyms may rarely co-occur. To address variability and idiosyncrasies in raw statistics, LSA applies Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), a dimensionality reduction technique related to PCA and Hebbian learning, to extract strongest clusters and underlying semantic structure. Thus, semantics is represented as distributed patterns reflecting the latent associations among words.  
   **External example:** LSA is widely used in text mining and information retrieval for capturing word meaning: https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/972801

5. **Q:** What are the core challenges in modeling syntax in neural networks, and how does the Sentence Gestalt model propose to address these issues differently from traditional syntactic tree structures?  
   **A:** Traditional syntax models require explicit bindings of words to syntactic roles (e.g., subject, object), involving rapid binding and unbinding that neural networks struggle with due to their reliance on stable synaptic connections. The Sentence Gestalt model circumvents this by forming a distributed, evolving representation of the overall sentence meaning (a gestalt), integrating semantics and syntax without explicit role-filler binding. This approach naturally accommodates syntactic ambiguity through semantics and maintains meaning representations incrementally without constructing rigid tree-like structures.  
   **External example:** Simple recurrent networks (SRNs) have also been used to model sentence-level processing by integrating sequential context: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00275508

6. **Q:** How does the Sentence Gestalt model utilize the DeepLeabra framework to maintain and update sentence meaning representations over time, and what biological plausibility does this confer?  
   **A:** The Sentence Gestalt model uses a context layer (GestaltD) that holds a copy of the gestalt layer’s representations from the prior time step, enabling incremental integration of new words into the evolving sentence meaning. The DeepLeabra implementation incorporates predictive learning with deep-layer temporal context representations analogous to the Pulvinar-thalamocortical loops in biology. This mirrors how the brain maintains working memory and integrates information over time, conferring biological plausibility through the mapping onto known neural circuits and learning mechanisms.

7. **Q:** Explain how semantic representations are distributed in the brain according to the text and what role the anterior temporal lobe ‘hub’ plays, especially for abstract words.  
   **A:** Semantic information for concrete words is encoded in domain-specific sensory and motor brain areas corresponding to the word’s experiential attributes (e.g., auditory cortex encodes sounds). In contrast, the anterior temporal lobe, particularly its tip or 'pole,' acts as a semantic hub integrating this distributed information, crucially supporting representations of abstract words that lack direct sensory-motor correlates. This hub likely coordinates and binds distributed semantic features into coherent meaning.

8. **Q:** What characteristics of English spelling-to-sound correspondences make it particularly challenging for computational models, and how does the discussed reading model address these challenges?  
   **A:** English orthography is highly irregular and context-dependent, with many subregularities and exceptions (e.g., the pronunciation of ‘i’ depends on surrounding letters; silent letters like in ‘mnemonic’; multi-letter groups like ‘ough’ have multiple pronunciations). These complexities require models to account for complex contextual dependencies, long-range interactions, and exceptions. The reading model addresses this by using hierarchical object recognition principles to capture spatially invariant letter combinations, allowing it to leverage partial regularities and deep contextual interactions, enabling generalization to nonwords and handling exceptions.  
   **External example:** The dual-route cascaded (DRC) model also handles English irregularities by combining lexical and sublexical routes: https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/BF03195096

9. **Q:** How does the model-based understanding of acquired dyslexias relate to the anatomical predictions concerning damage locations, and what evidence supports this?  
   **A:** The triangle model links different dyslexias to damage in specific pathways: phonological dyslexia to orthography-phonology connection damage; deep dyslexia to more severe damage in this pathway plus semantic involvement; surface dyslexia to damage in orthography-semantics pathway. Anatomically, these correspond to regions such as temporal cortex (semantic processing) and frontal cortex motor-related regions (phonological processing). Clinical observations that these different dyslexias correspond to lesions in predicted brain areas provide convergent validation of the functional-anatomical mappings predicted by the model.

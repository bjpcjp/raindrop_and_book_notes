This chapter explores how networks of excitatory pyramidal neurons and inhibitory interneurons in the neocortex produce emergent cognitive functions through hierarchical categorization, bidirectional excitatory dynamics, and inhibitory competition that regulate activity and enable sparse distributed representations. These processes support flexible, abstract representations and attractor dynamics critical for perception, attention, learning, and robust cognitive behavior.

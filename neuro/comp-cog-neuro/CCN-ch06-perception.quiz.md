1. **Q:** How does the hierarchical organization of visual processing in the ventral "what" pathway solve the problems of invariance and pattern discrimination in object recognition?
   **A:** The ventral "what" pathway incrementally solves invariance by having each processing layer integrate over a range of locations, sizes, and rotations, making neurons increasingly invariant as one moves up the hierarchy. Simultaneously, pattern discrimination is solved by building more complex combinations of feature detectors at each successive layer, enhancing the ability to distinguish similar input patterns. This interleaved, hierarchical approach prevents loss of spatial relationship information necessary for object discrimination and avoids impractical learning redundancies at numerous locations.
   **External example:** The hierarchical feature learning in convolutional neural networks similarly increases invariance and discrimination, as illustrated by Krizhevsky et al.'s AlexNet model for object recognition: https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2012/hash/c399862d3b9d6b76c8436e924a68c45b-Abstract.html

2. **Q:** What biological and computational mechanisms explain the topographic organization of orientation-tuned V1 neurons?
   **A:** Biologically, neighboring V1 neurons encode similar orientations due to excitatory lateral connections causing neighboring neurons to activate together. Computationally, self-organizing learning algorithms like XCAL extract dominant statistical regularities of natural images—primarily oriented edges—and activity-dependent learning causes neurons that frequently co-activate to develop similar orientation tuning, resulting in a continuous topographic map with features like pinwheel structures.

3. **Q:** How does the dorsal "where/how" pathway contribute to spatial attention and what evidence from neurological conditions supports this role?
   **A:** The dorsal pathway encodes spatial information essential for directing a "spotlight" of spatial attention, which focuses processing on specific spatial locations and supports object recognition in cluttered scenes. Damage to the right parietal cortex in this pathway causes hemispatial neglect, where patients ignore the contralateral (usually left) side of space. This is supported by behavioral deficits like slowed reaction times in the left visual field, neglect in drawing tasks, and abnormal line bisections. Additionally, bilateral damage leads to Balint’s syndrome, marked by impaired attention to multiple objects, showing the pathway’s critical role in spatial attention.

4. **Q:** Why is it insufficient to attempt invariant object recognition or pattern discrimination alone, and how does the incremental hierarchical solution overcome this?
   **A:** Attempting full invariance initially discards spatial relationships necessary to discriminate similar objects (e.g., differentiating a T from an L), while attempting complex discrimination at all locations is computationally impractical due to the vast variability in object appearances. The hierarchical solution incrementally increases feature complexity and invariance, preserving relational information at intermediate levels and enabling learning of object categories only after invariance has been moderately achieved, thus addressing both problems efficiently.

5. **Q:** Describe the nature of retinal information processing that enables the detection of edges rather than uniform illumination, including the role of center-surround receptive fields.
   **A:** Retinal cells have center-surround receptive fields (on-center/off-surround or vice versa) modeled by Difference-of-Gaussian filters, which respond only when there is contrast between the center and surround regions. These cells cancel out uniformly illuminated regions, thus filtering out irrelevant stimuli and emphasizing edges where illumination transitions from light to dark. This edge detection is foundational for later cortical processing.
   **External example:** The center-surround receptive field structure is a fundamental concept in visual neuroscience described by Kuffler (1953): https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1398996/

6. **Q:** How do interactions between the “what” and “where” visual pathways explain Posner spatial cueing task results and neglect phenomena better than a disengage-only model?
   **A:** The interaction model posits bidirectional influences where the intact spatial pathway competes with the damaged one to direct attention. Damage reduces competition in the affected hemifield, causing neglect. This explains why neglect is most pronounced when there is a cue to compete against. Unlike Posner’s disengage-only model—which predicts bilateral damage slows disengagement on both sides—the interaction model predicts bilateral damage reduces attentional competition and cueing effects, matching observed Balint’s syndrome behavior.

7. **Q:** What are the primary roles of V1, V2, V4, and IT cortex areas in the ventral visual processing stream, and how do receptive field size and complexity change across them?
   **A:** V1 encodes oriented edges with small receptive fields; V2 combines edges into junctions and encodes additional features like depth and texture with larger receptive fields; V4 detects more complex shapes over even larger areas; posterior IT (PIT) detects entire objects across wide spatial regions, and anterior IT encodes highly abstract semantic categories. From V1 to anterior IT, neurons show progressively larger receptive fields and respond to increasingly complex visual features.

8. **Q:** How does spatial attention facilitate object recognition in cluttered scenes, and what experimental evidence from visual search tasks supports this?
   **A:** Spatial attention acts as a "spotlight" that focuses processing resources on limited spatial regions, effectively filtering out competing objects and reducing confusion. In cluttered scenes like “Where’s Waldo” puzzles, attention must sequentially select regions for object recognition to function efficiently. Posner’s spatial cueing experiments show faster target detection when attention is pre-directed (valid cues), demonstrating attention’s role in guiding processing.

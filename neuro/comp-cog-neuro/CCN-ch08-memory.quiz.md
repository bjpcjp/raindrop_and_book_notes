1. **Q:** Explain the mechanisms by which the hippocampus optimizes episodic memory encoding and recall, including the roles of sparse neural activity, pattern separation, and pattern completion.
   **A:** The hippocampus encodes episodic memories using highly sparse neural activity, meaning relatively few neurons are active for any episode, minimizing overlap and interference among memories (pattern separation). This sparseness is achieved through high inhibition and diffuse connectivity from EC to DG and CA3, resulting in conjunctive neural representations. During recall, pattern completion occurs via recurrent connections in CA3 that allow partial cues to re-activate the full stored memory, propagating from CA3 to CA1 to entorhinal cortex and then to neocortex, enabling content-addressable memory. A tradeoff exists between pattern separation (encoding new memories distinctly) and pattern completion (retrieving existing memories), optimized by hippocampal anatomy and possibly modulated by prefrontal cortex.
   **External example:** The role of the hippocampus in pattern separation and completion has been confirmed in human fMRI studies showing distinct hippocampal activation patterns during encoding and retrieval tasks.

2. **Q:** Describe the complementary learning systems framework, including how it resolves catastrophic interference in neural networks and the distinct roles of the hippocampus and neocortex.
   **A:** The complementary learning systems (CLS) framework posits two memory systems: the hippocampus supports rapid, interference-resistant one-shot learning of episodic memories through sparse, pattern-separated representations, while the neocortex learns slowly via overlapping distributed representations optimized for semantic/general knowledge extraction and statistical inference. This specialization resolves catastrophic interference—which occurs when new learning in generic networks overwrites old memories—because the hippocampus rapidly encodes distinct episodic information without disruption, and the neocortex gradually consolidates generalized knowledge over time via interleaved learning.
   **External example:** CLS is supported by evidence from studies showing temporally graded retrograde amnesia where recent episodic memories depend on the hippocampus whereas older memories are consolidated in the neocortex.

3. **Q:** How does the AB-AC list learning task illustrate the difference between generic cortical neural networks and the hippocampal system in managing interference, and what neural mechanisms mitigate catastrophic interference?
   **A:** The AB-AC task involves learning an initial list of word pairs (AB) and subsequently a new list with the same cues but new associates (AC). Generic cortical neural networks suffer catastrophic interference, losing all recall of AB items after AC learning, due to highly overlapping representations and rapid learning rates. Humans, however, retain about 50% of AB recall after AC learning. The hippocampus mitigates interference by producing sparse, non-overlapping neural patterns (pattern separation) and employing high inhibition, enabling rapid one-shot learning without overwriting prior memories. Increasing inhibition and sparsity in network models similarly reduces interference.
   **External example:** Catastrophic interference effects and hippocampal pattern separation have been demonstrated in human behavioral studies and computational modeling, e.g., Norman & O’Reilly’s dual-process recognition memory model. (Norman & O’Reilly, 2003, Psychological Review) https://doi.org/10.1037/0033-295X.110.2.611

4. **Q:** What evidence supports the role of the hippocampus in memory consolidation and the temporal gradient observed in retrograde amnesia?
   **A:** Evidence includes the temporally graded retrograde amnesia in patient H.M., who lost recent episodic memories but retained older ones after hippocampal removal, indicating gradual neocortical consolidation of memories initially encoded by the hippocampus. Neural recordings show reactivation of hippocampal activity patterns during sleep, suggesting memory replay supports transfer to neocortex. Additionally, inducing slow-wave oscillations during human sleep enhances hippocampal-dependent memory, consistent with consolidation processes.
   **External example:** Studies on sleep-dependent consolidation, such as Marshall et al. (2006) showing improved memory after targeted slow-wave oscillation stimulation. https://doi.org/10.1038/nature04463

5. **Q:** Differentiate between familiarity-based recognition memory and recollective episodic memory, including their neuroanatomical correlates and behavioral characteristics.
   **A:** Familiarity-based recognition is a graded sense that a stimulus was recently experienced, supported by the perirhinal cortex with relatively coarse, single-trial cortical traces that enhance neuron activation sharpness; it does not provide detailed episodic recall. Recollective episodic memory involves explicit retrieval of detailed contextual information and depends on the hippocampus. Behaviorally, familiarity provides a scalar signal accessible consciously, whereas recollection allows rich, content-addressable recall. Dual-process recognition models emphasize these distinct but complementary memory contributions.
   **External example:** Evidence from hippocampal lesion patients retaining familiarity-driven recognition but impaired in recollection (Yonelinas, 2002, Trends in Cognitive Sciences) https://doi.org/10.1016/S1364-6613(00)01838-7

6. **Q:** Explain the difference between weight-based and activation-based priming, including their durations, neural mechanisms, and behavioral manifestations.
   **A:** Weight-based priming arises from synaptic plasticity changes in cortical circuits following one or a few exposures, producing long-lasting effects (sometimes over a year) measurable through behavioral speedups or response biases, but typically unconscious. Activation-based priming depends on residual neural firing that lasts only seconds to minutes, quickly dissipating with cessation of activity, and also influences reaction times without conscious awareness. Both forms modulate perceptual and cognitive processing but differ in stability and mechanisms.
   **External example:** Long-lasting repetition priming effects without hippocampal involvement demonstrated in word stem completion tasks (Schacter & Buckner, 1998, Neuron) https://doi.org/10.1016/S0896-6273(00)80455-6

7. **Q:** Discuss the functional significance of theta oscillations in the hippocampus regarding encoding and retrieval dynamics and how the different hippocampal subareas interact within this rhythm.
   **A:** Theta oscillations (~8-12 Hz in rats) temporally segregate hippocampal processing phases: EC inputs strongly drive CA1 during one theta phase facilitating encoding (plus phase for error-driven learning), while CA3 inputs dominate during the opposite phase promoting recall (minus phase). This alternating dynamic allows the hippocampus to balance encoding new information and retrieving existing memories within the same theta cycle, enhancing learning efficiency. The CA1-EC autoencoder pathway and CA3-CA1 recurrent connectivity are coordinated by these phase-specific inputs.
   **External example:** Empirical support from rodent electrophysiology demonstrating hippocampal theta phase-dependent encoding and recall (Hasselmo et al., 2002, Behavioral Neuroscience) https://doi.org/10.1037/0735-7044.116.6.1214

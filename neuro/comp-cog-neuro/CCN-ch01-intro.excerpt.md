This book explores the complex mechanisms of the human brain through computational cognitive neuroscience, emphasizing how simple neural interactions scale to produce sophisticated cognitive functions across diverse domains such as perception, memory, and executive control. By integrating biological constraints with cognitive modeling, it highlights the importance of computer simulations to understand brain function, learning, and emergent phenomena, while addressing the relationship between neural hardware and cognitive algorithms.

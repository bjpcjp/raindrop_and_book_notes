The chapter explores the sensory-motor loop underlying cognition, focusing on the basal ganglia’s role in action selection through reinforcement learning driven by dopamine-based reward prediction errors, and the cerebellum’s function in refining motor actions via error-driven learning informed by climbing fiber inputs. It highlights distinct neural circuits and learning mechanisms in these structures, detailing how dopamine signals modulate Go/NoGo pathways in the basal ganglia and how the cerebellum utilizes high-dimensional input representations to enable precise motor control.

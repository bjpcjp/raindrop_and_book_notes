Perception, particularly vision, relies on hierarchical processing in the brain where primary visual cortex (V1) detects oriented edges through self-organizing learning, and higher areas in the ventral “what” pathway incrementally build invariant object recognition despite variability in appearance. The dorsal “where/how” pathway supports spatial attention, enabling focus on specific locations within complex scenes, with disruptions causing conditions like hemispatial neglect and Balint’s syndrome, explained by models of interaction and competition between spatial and object recognition pathways.

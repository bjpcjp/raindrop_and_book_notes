Computational Cognitive Neuroscience explores how simple neural mechanisms, particularly the integration of excitatory, inhibitory, and leak inputs by individual neurons and their synaptic weights, give rise to complex cognitive functions through networks in the neocortex. By combining biological data and computational models, it explains phenomena such as perception, memory, language, and executive function as emergent properties of neural circuits structured in layered, bidirectionally connected networks that categorize inputs, regulate activity via inhibition, and adapt through learning.

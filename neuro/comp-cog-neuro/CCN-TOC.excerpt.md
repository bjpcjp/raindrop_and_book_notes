This document provides a comprehensive overview of the biological and computational foundations of neural function, exploring the neuronâ€™s structure and dynamics, network connectivity, and learning mechanisms. It further examines brain areas and their roles in perception, motor control, memory, language, and executive function, integrating neuroscience with computational models such as Leabra and PVLV.

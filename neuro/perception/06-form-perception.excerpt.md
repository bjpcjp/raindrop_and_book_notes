Form perception involves extracting intelligible shapes from complex retinal stimuli through mechanisms such as contour detection, lateral inhibition, and Gestalt organizational principles, while the theory of multiple spatial channels explains how the visual system processes spatial frequencies to recognize forms. Recognition relies on feature analysis and structural models like geons, with deficits in these processes manifesting as various types of agnosia, including the inability to recognize objects or faces.

1. **Q:** Describe the structural and functional components of the eyeball that enable the transformation of light into neural signals, including the roles of the cornea, lens, pupil, and retina.
   **A:** The eyeball contains the cornea, a curved, transparent membrane that first bends incoming light rays, and the pupil, an opening controlled by the iris that regulates light entry. The lens further adjusts the focus through accommodation—becoming rounder for near objects and flatter for distant ones. Light is focused onto the retina, the innermost layer where photoreceptors (rods and cones) convert light into nerve impulses. The retina also contains bipolar, ganglion, horizontal, and amacrine cells that process and transmit this information further.

2. **Q:** Explain the differences between rods and cones in the retina in terms of their structure, function, distribution, and spectral sensitivity.
   **A:** Rods are elongated photoreceptors sensitive to low light levels (scotopic vision), concentrated more in the periphery, and contain rhodopsin, absorbing light between 400-600 nm. Cones are shorter, responsible for daytime and color vision (photopic system), concentrated centrally especially at the fovea, with three pigment types sensitive to long, medium, and short wavelengths. Rods provide motion and shape perception in dim light, while cones offer sharp acuity and color discrimination.

3. **Q:** Discuss the significance of receptive fields in ganglion cells, including the types of responses to light and the organization into on-center and off-center receptive fields.
   **A:** Each ganglion cell is associated with a receptive field on the retina where light stimulation affects its electrical activity in three response types: “on” (increased activity during light), “off” (activity suppressed during light, increased after), and “on-off” (alternating responses). Receptive fields are circular with either an on-center/off-surround configuration—center stimulation excites and surrounding inhibits—or an off-center/on-surround configuration. This arrangement allows ganglion cells to detect contrasts in light over spatial areas.

4. **Q:** Compare and contrast magnocellular (magno) and parvocellular (parvo) ganglion cells in terms of their physiological properties, receptive field size, conduction velocity, and functional specialization.
   **A:** Magnocellular cells represent about 10% of ganglion cells, have larger receptive fields (e.g., 0.5 mm at 10 mm from fovea), larger cell bodies and axons, higher conduction speed (~40 m/s), and respond jerkily with high contrast sensitivity, particularly to movement and large objects. Parvocellular cells form about 80%, have smaller receptive fields (~0.01 mm), smaller bodies and axons, slower conduction speed (~20 m/s), continuous responses, lower contrast sensitivity, and specialize in processing color and fine stationary details.

5. **Q:** Outline the flow of visual information from the retina through central brain structures including the optic chiasm, lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), superior colliculus, and visual cortex, noting the functional contributions of each.
   **A:** Retinal ganglion cell axons form the optic nerve, which partially crosses at the optic chiasm so that nasal retinal fibers project contralaterally while temporal fibers remain ipsilateral. The optic tract then carries signals mainly to the LGN and superior colliculus. The LGN, organized in six layers, processes form and color with retinotopic mapping, while the superior colliculus primarily guides eye movement and spatial localization. LGN outputs project to the primary visual cortex (V1) where detailed processing begins; secondary visual cortices (V2–V5) further analyze form, color (V4), and motion (V5).

6. **Q:** Describe the organizational and functional characteristics of the primary visual cortex (V1) including cellular types identified by Hubel and Wiesel, retinotopic mapping, and columnar architecture.
   **A:** V1 is located in the occipital lobe with a retinotopic layout prioritizing central vision (fovea). Hubel and Wiesel identified simple cells with orientation-selective elongated receptive fields in V1’s layer 4c, complex cells sensitive to direction of motion in layers 2,3,5,6, and hypercomplex (end-stopped) cells responding to edges with specific orientations. V1 is organized into vertical columns of cells responsive to similar orientations; lateral shifts yield gradual orientation preference changes, forming hypercolumns about 2 mm² each, with approximately 6400 hypercolumns containing 15,000 cells each.

7. **Q:** Explain the major visual processing pathways beyond V1, specifying the dorsal (magnoparietal) and ventral (parvotemporal) streams including their functional specializations and associated cortical areas.
   **A:** The dorsal pathway (magnoparietal, median temporal, or “where/how” pathway) involves ~10% of ganglion cells, passes through area V5, and is specialized for motion perception and spatial localization. The ventral pathway (parvotemporal or “what” pathway) involves areas V2 and V4, with V4 specializing in color processing and object identification. The dorsal stream is thus essential for processing motion and guiding eye movements, while the ventral stream evaluates form and color for object recognition.

8. **Q:** Identify and characterize various clinical visual disorders related to refraction, retinal damage, and muscular dysfunction, including their causes and typical corrective measures.
   **A:** Refractive errors include hypermetropia (light focused behind the retina causing poor near vision, corrected by biconvex lenses) and myopia (light focused before the retina causing poor distant vision, corrected by biconcave lenses or laser surgery). Astigmatism arises from nonspherical corneal curvature causing direction-dependent blurring. Presbyopia results from lens hardening with age, reducing near focus ability. Retinal disorders include macular degeneration (loss of central vision), diabetic retinopathy, and retinal detachment. Muscular disorders include strabismus (misalignment causing double vision) and nystagmus (involuntary eye movements). Glaucoma is caused by optic nerve degeneration often due to elevated intraocular pressure.

Gustav Fechner proposed that the relationship between stimulus magnitude and sensation is logarithmic, quantified by the just-noticeable difference (JND) based on the Weber fraction, with the absolute threshold as zero. However, this indirect method was flawed due to variability in the Weber fraction, and Stevensâ€™ direct approach to linking stimulus magnitude with sensory magnitude proved more effective.

1. **Q:** What are the main categories and types of cues involved in depth perception, and how do binocular and monocular cues differ in terms of information type and relative or absolute distance estimation?  
   **A:** Depth perception cues fall into three main dichotomies: extraocular (kinesthetic) vs. visual, pictorial (static) vs. kinematic (dynamic), and binocular vs. monocular. Binocular cues, requiring both eyes, include convergence (kinesthetic cue effective for absolute distance, especially within 6 meters) and retinal disparity (visual cue allowing relative depth perception via differences in images formed on each retina). Monocular cues, usable with one eye, include accommodation (kinesthetic for absolute distance), and visual cues like familiar size, occlusion, linear perspective, texture gradient, relative height, shading, relative brightness, aerial perspective, and motion parallax. Monocular cues mostly inform about relative distances, whereas binocular convergence provides absolute distance cues.  
   **External example:** A VR headset uses binocular disparity by sending slightly different images to each eye to create depth perception. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4093376/

2. **Q:** Explain the principle of perceptual constancy with a focus on size constancy and discuss how the size-distance invariance hypothesis accounts for this phenomenon, including key experimental evidence.  
   **A:** Perceptual constancy allows the observer to perceive constant object properties despite changing retinal images. Size constancy means an object’s perceived size remains stable even as its retinal image size decreases with distance. The size-distance invariance hypothesis posits that perceived size depends on both the retinal image size and the perceived distance. Holway and Boring’s (1941) experiment showed that when distance cues were available, participants adjusted comparison stimuli to match the perceived true size of objects at varying distances, supporting the hypothesis. When cues were reduced or removed (monocular with artificial pupil and low light), size constancy diminished, indicating distance information is necessary for size constancy.  
   **External example:** The Ames room illusion, where manipulated depth cues cause distorted size perception, illustrates the importance of depth cues in size constancy. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4740508/

3. **Q:** What are the attentional phenomena of change blindness and attentional blindness, and how do they illustrate the role of attention in conscious perception?  
   **A:** Change blindness is the failure to notice substantial changes in a visual scene, especially when changes occur during visual disruptions; attentional blindness is the failure to perceive a fully visible object when attention is engaged elsewhere. Both phenomena demonstrate that conscious perception requires focused attention; without it, even large and salient stimuli may go unnoticed. This indicates that attention limits the quantity of information reaching conscious awareness, as shown by the classic "invisible gorilla" experiment.  
   **External example:** The "invisible gorilla" experiment demonstrates attentional blindness, where participants focusing on counting ball passes often miss seeing a person in a gorilla suit. https://www.simonsfoundation.org/2010/11/15/invisible-gorilla-experiment/

4. **Q:** Describe Posner and Cohen's (1984) "inhibition of return" effect and how it relates to the temporal dynamics of spatial attention.  
   **A:** Inhibition of return refers to the phenomenon where attention initially facilitates detection of stimuli at a cued location (within ~100 ms), but after a delay (~300–500 ms), reaction times become faster for stimuli appearing at uncued locations than at the previously cued spot. This suggests attention is reluctant to re-engage at recently attended locations once disengaged, possibly linked to mechanisms preparing the visual system for new stimuli and efficient scanning, and may be related to neural systems involved in eye movements.  
   **External example:** The inhibition of return effect is utilized in visual search tasks to explain how attention is biased away from previously attended locations, aiding efficient exploration. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3011178/

5. **Q:** How does the partial report method developed by Sperling (1960) advance our understanding of visual sensory memory and the limitations of attentional capacity?  
   **A:** Sperling's partial report method demonstrated that although participants can recall only ~4–5 letters in full report, they initially store a much larger array of visual information briefly in sensory memory (iconic memory). When cued immediately after presentation to report a specific row, participants recalled about 3 letters per row, implying that all 12 letters were momentarily available before sensory decay. The advantage diminishes with increased delay, showing the transient nature of iconic memory and indicating that attentional capacity limits the transfer of sensory input into working memory rather than the initial sensory registration.  
   **External example:** Studies on iconic memory validate the partial report's findings, showing visual information lasts approximately 250 ms in sensory memory before fading. https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1364661306001281

6. **Q:** Discuss the evidence from dichotic listening experiments that challenges early filter theories of attention and supports the concept of a late selection or attenuator model.  
   **A:** Early filter models (Broadbent, 1958) proposed that attentional selection occurs early, filtering out unattended stimuli at a sensory level. However, dichotic listening studies by Gray and Wedderburn (1960) and Anne Treisman showed participants could follow messages that switched ears mid-sentence, suggesting semantic processing of unattended input occurs before selection. Treisman's attenuator model posits unattended messages are attenuated but not completely blocked, allowing meaning-based shifts of attention. Thus, attentional selection is late, occurring after some semantic analysis, contrary to early filter assumptions.  
   **External example:** The cocktail party effect, where hearing one’s name in an unattended conversation captures attention, illustrates late selection processing. https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010028509000871

7. **Q:** Explain the feature integration theory of visual search and how it accounts for distinctions between pop-out effects and conjunction searches, including the concept of illusory conjunctions.  
   **A:** The feature integration theory posits two stages: a preattentive stage where individual features (color, shape, orientation) are processed in parallel automatically, enabling pop-out effects (targets distinguished by a single salient feature detected rapidly, regardless of distractor number); and an attentive binding stage where features are integrated to identify objects, requiring focused attention and serial processing, particularly for conjunction searches (targets defined by combinations of features), which take longer and are affected by distractor number. Illusory conjunctions (misbinding of features) occur when binding fails under difficult conditions, evidencing the necessity of attention for feature integration.  
   **External example:** Visual search experiments show that a red circle among green circles pops out, but a red circle among red squares and green circles requires attention to correctly bind features. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2842679/

8. **Q:** What are hemineglect, extinction, Balint syndrome, and blindsight, and how do these neurological conditions illustrate the relationship between attention and perception?  
   **A:** Hemineglect is the failure to attend to the side of space opposite a brain lesion (often right hemisphere lesions causing left-sided neglect). Extinction is a subtype where contralateral stimuli are perceived only if presented alone, disappearing when competing ipsilateral stimuli are present. Balint syndrome (from bilateral parietal lesions) causes simultagnosia, the inability to perceive more than one object at a time. Blindsight occurs in patients with cortical blindness who cannot consciously see but can respond to visual stimuli above chance. These illustrate that attention and awareness are distinct; some perception operates without attention or consciousness.  
   **External example:** Patients with hemineglect ignore stimuli on their left side, often failing to eat food on one half of their plate. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK538295/

9. **Q:** How does the moon illusion exemplify the interplay of perceptual constancy, size-distance invariance, and depth cues in visual perception?  
   **A:** The moon illusion is the phenomenon where the moon appears larger on the horizon than at the zenith despite having the same retinal size and distance. According to Kaufman and Rock, this is because on the horizon, the moon is perceived as farther away due to the presence of depth cues and landmarks, invoking size-distance invariance: with identical retinal size but greater perceived distance, apparent size increases. Perceptual constancy mechanisms thus interpret the size as larger on the horizon. At zenith, fewer landmarks cause the moon to be perceived as closer and smaller.  
   **External example:** Psychophysical experiments confirm the moon illusion arises from cognitive interpretations of distance cues rather than optical factors. https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00140139208964680

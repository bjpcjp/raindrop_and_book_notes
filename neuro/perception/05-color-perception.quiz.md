1. **Q:** How do the physical properties of light (intensity, wavelength, spectral composition) and the surface properties (reflectance, transmission) jointly determine the color perception experienced by the human visual system?
   **A:** The light that reaches the eye and produces color perception depends on the intensity (luminance), wavelength composition (spectral makeup), and purity of the incoming light, as well as the surface’s reflectance or transmission properties. Radiance from a source becomes illuminance when it hits a surface, and the surface’s reflectance coefficient determines how much of that illuminance is reflected as luminance. This reflected luminance, modified by the spectral composition of both source and surface, stimulates the retina to create color perception, integrating intensity, wavelength, and purity information.

2. **Q:** Describe the three fundamental perceptual dimensions of color and how they relate to the physical properties of light.
   **A:** The three fundamental perceptual dimensions are hue (the perceived color category determined by dominant wavelength), brightness (perceived lightness or intensity of the color, from black to white), and saturation (degree of purity or vividness related to the amount of gray mixed with the hue). Hue corresponds to wavelength composition, brightness corresponds to light intensity, and saturation relates to purity of spectral composition, ranging from monochromatic light (high saturation) to white or gray (low saturation).
   **External example:** Color measurement in digital imaging uses hue, brightness (value), and saturation to describe color properties, as standardized by the HSV color model. https://www.colorhexa.com/hsv-to-rgb

3. **Q:** Explain the difference between additive and subtractive color mixtures, and why they produce different results when mixing the same colors.
   **A:** Additive mixtures add wavelengths of two or more light sources, resulting in a brighter color than the original components, and mixing complementary colors yields white. Subtractive mixtures involve pigments or dyes that absorb (subtract) certain wavelengths and reflect others, so mixing pigments leads to fewer reflected wavelengths and darker colors. For example, mixing blue and yellow pigments (subtractive) produces green due to absorption, unlike mixing blue and yellow light beams (additive) which yields white or a lighter color. This difference explains why mixing colors with paints differs from mixing light.

4. **Q:** Summarize the two main historical theories of color vision and describe how modern physiological findings reconcile them.
   **A:** The trichromatic theory (Young-Helmholtz) posits three types of cones sensitive to short (blue), medium (green), and long (red) wavelengths, each responding to all wavelengths but maximally to one. The opponent-process theory (Hering) states color perception depends on neurons encoding opposing pairs: red-green, blue-yellow, and white-black. Modern data show that three cone types provide input, but at subsequent neural stages (ganglion cells, lateral geniculate nucleus), opponent processing occurs, combining the two theories into a two-level system explaining hue, brightness, and saturation.

5. **Q:** How do chromatic effects such as spatial and temporal optical mixing, simultaneous contrast, assimilation, and afterimages demonstrate that color perception depends on neural processing beyond physical light stimulus?
   **A:** These effects show that perceived color is influenced by contextual, temporal, and neural adaptation mechanisms not directly explained by physical stimulus alone. Spatial and temporal mixing blend colors beyond physical wavelengths, simultaneous contrast makes colors appear different based on surround hues via lateral inhibition or unconscious inference, assimilation causes colors to borrow neighbors’ hues, and afterimages (including the McCollough effect) arise from receptor fatigue and higher visual area adaptation. These phenomena highlight the brain’s active role in interpreting color.
   **External example:** The phenomenon of afterimages is documented by the American Psychological Association as evidence of neural adaptation affecting color perception. https://www.apa.org/science/about/psa/2015/06/afterimage

6. **Q:** What are the categories and genetic basis of common color vision disorders, and how do they affect perception of primary colors?
   **A:** The main categories are abnormal trichromatism (partial insensitivity), abnormal dichromatism (complete insensitivity), and monochromatism (very rare, complete lack of functioning cones). Most common are red-green deficits (protanomaly and deuteranomaly/anopia), affecting mostly men due to defective genes on the X chromosome. Protanomaly requires more red to perceive yellow; deuteranomaly requires more green. Dichromatism leads to blindness to one primary color, altering color discrimination and reducing perception to fewer hues.
   **External example:** The NIH explains red-green color blindness as an X-linked trait affecting mostly males with protan and deutan types. https://www.nei.nih.gov/learn-about-eye-health/eye-conditions-and-diseases/color-blindness

7. **Q:** Describe how the concept of primary colors and complementary colors is grounded in the physics of light and human color perception, including how Newton’s prism experiment contributed to this understanding.
   **A:** Newton’s prism experiment showed white light contains a spectrum of all colors (wavelengths). Primary colors are three chosen hues (red, green, blue) whose additive mixing can generate the full color range, including white. Complementary colors are pairs which, when mixed in equal intensity, produce white or gray, positioned opposite each other on the color wheel. The physical basis reflects the eye’s three cone types and wavelength interactions, allowing color synthesis by combinations of these primaries.

8. **Q:** How does the opponent process theory explain the impossibility of perceiving certain color mixtures like "greenish red," and what physiological evidence supports this?
   **A:** Opponent-process theory posits that colors are encoded in mutually inhibitory pairs (red-green, blue-yellow), so neural responses activated by one member of a pair inhibit the other, making simultaneous perception of "greenish red" impossible. Physiological evidence from ganglion cells and lateral geniculate nucleus shows neurons excited by one wavelength and inhibited by the opponent color. This neural organization underlies the perceptual absence of such hybrid colors.
   **External example:** Research from Harvard’s Vision Lab confirms opponent neurons prevent simultaneous perception of opposite hues. https://visionscience.harvard.edu/lectures/neurology-color-vision

9. **Q:** Explain how brightness and saturation differ in their roles in color perception, and how non-opponent and opponent neural processes contribute to these dimensions.
   **A:** Brightness refers to perceived lightness/darkness and correlates with stimulus intensity; it is explained by non-opponent neural processes responding to white-black contrasts. Saturation refers to perceived purity or vividness of color and depends on how strongly opponent circuits (red-green, blue-yellow) are activated relative to non-opponent ones. Higher opponent activity relative to brightness processing leads to more saturated colors; brightness modulates perceived lightness independent of hue or saturation.
   **External example:** Neuroscience research shows white-black ganglion cells modulate brightness, while opponent cells regulate hue and saturation (DeValois & DeValois, 1975). https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4437720/

10. **Q:** In what ways do color constancy mechanisms preserve stable perception of object colors under varying lighting conditions, and what does this imply about the processing of spectral information?
    **A:** Color constancy allows recognition of an object's true color despite changes in illumination's spectral composition and intensity by adjusting the neural interpretation of color signals to discount lighting effects. This suggests the visual system transmits relative spectral differences and integrates context to maintain consistent color perception, rather than purely reflecting physical stimulus. Thus, color perception includes complex processing to maintain stable representations.
    **External example:** The phenomenon of color constancy is demonstrated in studies by the CIE and vision science research on adaptive color perception. https://www.cis.rit.edu/research/lighting/color_constancy/

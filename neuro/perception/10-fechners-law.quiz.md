1. **Q:** What is the fundamental hypothesis behind Fechner’s Law regarding the relationship between stimulus magnitude and sensation magnitude, and how is the just-noticeable difference (JND) involved in this hypothesis?  
   **A:** Fechner hypothesized that the relationship between the magnitude of a stimulus and the magnitude of sensation is logarithmic. He introduced the just-noticeable difference (JND) as a unit of sensation magnitude, which can be indirectly quantified based on the Weber fraction. The absolute threshold serves as the zero point in his psychological scale.  
   **External example:** Fechner’s Law describes the logarithmic relationship in auditory perception, such as how sound loudness grows logarithmically with increasing sound intensity. https://www.britannica.com/science/psychophysics

2. **Q:** How does Fechner’s scale calculate successive JNDs for a stimulus with an absolute threshold of 10 and a Weber fraction of 0.3, and what pattern emerges from these calculations?  
   **A:** Starting from the absolute threshold (10), each successive JND is obtained by adding the Weber fraction (30%) of the current stimulus value to itself, yielding a series like 13, 16.9, 21.97, etc. This produces values that increase multiplicatively and when plotted against the stimulus intensity form a logarithmic curve.  
   **External example:** Similar calculations apply to brightness perception, where increments in brightness must be proportionally greater to be perceived as a difference. https://psycnet.apa.org/fulltext/1982-07867-001.html

3. **Q:** Explain the graphical relationship between stimulus intensity and JND when plotted on linear vs. logarithmic scales, according to Fechner’s findings.  
   **A:** When JND values are plotted against stimulus intensity on a linear scale, the relationship appears logarithmic (curved). However, when the logarithmic value of stimulus intensity is used on the x-axis, the relationship becomes linear, illustrating the underlying logarithmic function of sensation.  
   **External example:** Visual perception of brightness demonstrates this effect, where plotting perceived brightness on a log scale linearizes the relationship with physical luminance. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2916777/

4. **Q:** What is the general formula representing Fechner’s Law and what does each variable represent?  
   **A:** The formula is JND = K log ϕ, where JND is the sensation magnitude, K is a multiplicative constant specific to the sensory modality and dimension, and ϕ is the stimulus intensity above the absolute threshold.  
   **External example:** This formula is used in tactile perception studies where sensation magnitude is related to stimulus pressure intensity. https://doi.org/10.3758/BF03203111

5. **Q:** What was Fechner’s interpretation of the psychological meaning of the fourth JND compared to the second JND, and why was this interpretation later criticized?  
   **A:** Fechner believed the fourth JND corresponded to a sensation psychologically twice as intense as the second JND. This indirect approach was criticized because it relied on the Weber fraction, which is not constant and tends to be higher at low stimulus magnitudes, therefore misrepresenting the true sensory relationship.  
   **External example:** Research shows that Weber fractions vary with stimulus intensity in weight perception, contradicting Fechner’s assumption of equal JND increments. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2898780/

6. **Q:** Why was Stevens’ approach to the relationship between stimulus magnitude and sensation considered more effective than Fechner’s?  
   **A:** Stevens’ approach was more direct and did not rely on the indirect use of a constant Weber fraction; instead, it measured sensation magnitude directly, which allowed for more accurate representation of the stimulus-sensation relationship, overcoming the limitations in Fechner’s logarithmic assumption.  
   **External example:** Stevens’ Power Law is widely used for scaling pain intensity directly in medical psychophysics. https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0301051118302187

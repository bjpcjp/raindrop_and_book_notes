The chapter describes the biological structures and mechanisms underlying visual perception, focusing on the eye's anatomy, retinal organization, and neural pathways to the brain, including the roles of different retinal cells and visual cortex areas. It also addresses common visual disorders related to focusing problems, retinal diseases, and muscular dysfunctions that impair vision.

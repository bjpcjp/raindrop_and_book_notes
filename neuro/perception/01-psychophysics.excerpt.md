Psychophysics studies the relationship between physical stimuli and their psychological perception, focusing on detecting stimuli, discriminating differences, and scaling perceived intensity. Key concepts include absolute and difference thresholds, measured through various methods such as constant stimuli and signal detection theory, and Stevensâ€™s power law, which models the relationship between stimulus magnitude and psychological sensation.

1. **Q:** How do bottom-up and top-down attentional processes differ, and how do they influence perception according to the chapter?
   **A:** Bottom-up processing refers to attention captured involuntarily by stimuli from the environment (data-driven), while top-down processing involves voluntary allocation of attention based on prior knowledge or goals (concept-driven). Both influence perception by determining what information reaches conscious awareness among the vast sensory input.
   **External example:** The "cocktail party effect" illustrates top-down attention as listeners focus on a single conversation despite background noise. (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2913411/)

2. **Q:** Explain the phenomenon of "inhibition of return" in spatial attention, including its temporal characteristics and proposed mechanism.
   **A:** Inhibition of return occurs when attention is directed to a location and then disengaged, making it harder to reorient attention back to that same spot after a delay of 300–500 ms. Initially, with a cue-target SOA less than 100 ms, responses are faster (facilitation), but after that, reaction times become slower for the cued location, possibly involving mechanisms linked to eye movements.
   **External example:** Inhibition of return has been studied extensively to understand visual search efficiency, as in Posner and Cohen's original experiments. (https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1985-18453-001)

3. **Q:** Describe the partial report technique used by Sperling and how it reveals properties of sensory memory in vision.
   **A:** Sperling’s partial report technique presents participants with a brief display of multiple letters and cues them immediately afterward to report only one specific row. Participants can recall more letters per row than in whole-report, indicating that all information is initially available in a sensory register (iconic memory) for a very short period (~150 ms), before fading.
   **External example:** Iconic memory duration and capacity studied with partial report methods are foundational in understanding brief visual storage. (https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1960-03846-001)

4. **Q:** What does the attentional blink phenomenon demonstrate about the temporal limitations of selective attention?
   **A:** The attentional blink shows that after detecting one target in a rapid visual sequence, the ability to detect a second target is impaired for 200–500 ms post-first detection, suggesting limited attentional processing capacity over time. If two targets occur within 100 ms, both can be detected, implying a temporal bottleneck in attention allocation.
   **External example:** Attentional blink research informs cognitive models of attention and is well-documented in experimental psychology literature. (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2778081/)

5. **Q:** How do auditory selective attention experiments, such as dichotic listening, challenge early filter models and support late selection or attenuation theories?
   **A:** Dichotic listening tasks show participants primarily attend to one ear but can still detect meaningful information (e.g., their own name) from the unattended ear, indicating some semantic processing occurs before selection. This challenges Broadbent’s early-filter model that predicted filtering occurs only at low-level features and supports late selection models or Treisman’s attenuator, which propose partial processing of unattended stimuli.
   **External example:** Treisman’s attenuation model is a standard explanation for selective auditory attention demonstrated in dichotic listening studies. (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14440827/)

6. **Q:** Explain Treisman and Gelade’s feature integration theory of visual search, including the distinction between preattentive and attentive processing stages.
   **A:** The theory posits two stages: first, a preattentive stage processes simple visual features (e.g., color, orientation) in parallel automatically; second, an attentive stage integrates these features into coherent objects through focused attention applied serially. Illusory conjunctions, where features are incorrectly bound, occur when attentional resources are insufficient.
   **External example:** Feature integration theory remains influential in explaining visual search tasks and perceptual binding phenomena. (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0010028579900174)

7. **Q:** What clinical attentional deficits related to perception are described, and how do they illustrate the role of attention in conscious awareness?
   **A:** Hemineglect (inability to attend to stimuli contralateral to a right parietal lesion), extinction (seeing contralateral stimuli only if no ipsilateral stimulus competes), Balint syndrome (simultagnosia—only perceiving one object at a time), and blindsight (unconscious visual processing despite lack of conscious perception) demonstrate that attention is essential for conscious awareness but not always for behavior.
   **External example:** Hemineglect patients ignoring one side of space illustrate impaired attention as studied in neuropsychology. (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK279388/)

8. **Q:** What does the Stroop effect reveal about automatic processes and their interference with controlled attentional tasks?
   **A:** The Stroop effect shows that word reading is an automatic process that interferes with color naming—a task requiring controlled attention. Naming the ink color of conflicting color words takes more time because automatic word reading competes with the controlled task, highlighting limits of selective attention.
   **External example:** The Stroop task is a classic demonstration of interference caused by automaticity in cognitive psychology. (https://www.apa.org/research/action/stroop)

9. **Q:** How do experiments manipulating preparatory intervals (constant vs. variable preparatory periods) reveal temporal preparation effects on reaction time?
   **A:** In variable preparatory intervals, longer preparatory periods reduce reaction time because the increasing likelihood of stimulus appearance heightens readiness (temporal expectation). In constant intervals, longer preparatory times slow reaction due to increased variability or fatigue, showing that temporal predictability modulates attentional preparation.
   **External example:** The effect of temporal uncertainty on reaction time has been systematically studied in cognitive psychology reaction experiments. (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0028393208002549)

10. **Q:** What are ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curves, and how do they distinguish between sensitivity and decision criterion in detection tasks?
    **A:** ROC curves plot hit rates against false alarm rates and reveal sensitivity (discrimination ability, d′) by how far the curve is from the diagonal and response bias (decision criterion) by the position on the curve. Adjusting rewards or punishments shifts the criterion without affecting sensitivity. ROC analysis also tests assumptions of signal detection theory.
    **External example:** ROC analysis is widely used in psychophysics and signal detection research to separate perceptual sensitivity from decision biases. (https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/receiver-operating-characteristic)

1. **Q:** What are the main sensory capabilities studied in psychophysics, and how do the absolute and difference thresholds relate to these capabilities?
   **A:** Psychophysics primarily studies three sensory capabilities: detecting stimuli, discriminating between stimuli, and estimating stimulus value (scaling). The absolute threshold is the minimum intensity at which a stimulus can be detected (related to detection), while the difference threshold, or just noticeable difference (JND), is the minimum difference in magnitude between two stimuli necessary to discriminate them (related to discrimination).
   **External example:** The vibration detection threshold in human fingertips represents an absolute threshold; studies quantify this to assess touch sensitivity. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3699872/

2. **Q:** How does the method of constant stimuli estimate an absolute threshold, and what is the role of the psychometric function in this method?
   **A:** The method of constant stimuli involves presenting several stimulus intensities repeatedly and randomly, ranging from almost never perceived to almost always perceived. Observers indicate detection or non-detection for each stimulus, and the resulting frequencies are transformed into detection probabilities. These probabilities are plotted against stimulus magnitude to form a psychometric function—typically sigmoidal—where the absolute threshold is operationally defined at the stimulus level detected 50% of the time.
   **External example:** Psychometric functions are used in vision research, e.g., assessing contrast sensitivity thresholds in patients with glaucoma. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4327456/

3. **Q:** What problem in threshold estimation does Signal Detection Theory (SDT) address, and how do sensitivity (d') and decision criterion (ß) parameters differentiate observer performance?
   **A:** SDT addresses the confounding effect of observers’ decision biases on threshold estimation by separating true sensory sensitivity from their decision strategy. Sensitivity (d') quantifies the ability to discriminate signal from noise independent of criterion, calculated from hit and false alarm rates. Criterion (ß) reflects the observer’s willingness to say "yes" or "no," with conservative observers having high ß (fewer false alarms) and lax observers having low ß (more false alarms). This bifurcation allows accurate sensitivity measurement despite variable decisional styles.
   **External example:** SDT has been applied in medical imaging diagnostics to differentiate radiologists’ ability to detect tumors (sensitivity) from their decision thresholds (bias). https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15576001/

4. **Q:** Explain how the difference threshold is estimated using the constant stimuli method, including the concepts of point of subjective equality (PSE) and upper/lower difference thresholds.
   **A:** In the constant stimuli method for difference thresholds, a standard stimulus and several comparison stimuli varying around it are presented, and observers indicate which is heavier (or greater). A psychometric function plots the probability that the comparison stimulus is judged heavier. The PSE is where the judgment probability is 50%, meaning the stimuli appear equal. Difference thresholds are derived from stimulus magnitudes at 75% and 25% response levels, representing the upper and lower difference thresholds, respectively. Averaging or halving the interval between these thresholds estimates the just noticeable difference.
   **External example:** Differential thresholds in weight perception have been assessed in behavioral studies to quantify sensitivity in fine motor control tasks. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4530325/

5. **Q:** What limitation does Weber’s Law have regarding difference thresholds, and how is this limitation addressed by its generalized form?
   **A:** Weber’s Law states that the ratio of difference threshold (Δϕ) to stimulus magnitude (ϕ) is constant (K), implying proportional increase in difference threshold with stimulus magnitude. However, it breaks down at very low or very high stimulus intensities. The generalized form adds a constant sensory noise term (a), modifying the relationship to Δϕ = Kϕ + a, which accounts for higher Weber fractions at extreme intensities by incorporating sensory noise effects.
   **External example:** Auditory intensity discrimination follows Weber’s Law at mid-levels but deviates at very low sound levels, consistent with the generalized form. https://asa.scitation.org/doi/10.1121/1.1664959

6. **Q:** Compare and contrast the method of adjustment and the method of limits for threshold estimation, highlighting their applicability and potential sources of error.
   **A:** The method of adjustment requires observers to actively change stimulus intensity to reach threshold, yielding quick results best suited for difference thresholds with continuously variable stimuli presented simultaneously. The method of limits presents stimuli in ascending or descending order until perception changes; it suits both absolute and difference thresholds but can be affected by habituation (tendency to respond same across trials) and anticipation (predicting transition) errors. The method of adjustment yields variability-based difference thresholds, while method of limits relies on averaged transition points.
   **External example:** Method of adjustment is commonly used in pitch matching tasks in auditory research, while method of limits is used to determine auditory thresholds in hearing tests. https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378595514002603

7. **Q:** What are the theoretical assumptions underlying the psychometric function used in absolute threshold estimation, and why is the cumulative normal function often employed?
   **A:** The psychometric function assumes the detection phenomenon is continuous but measured by discrete observations approximating a continuous distribution. It is assumed that responses follow a cumulative distribution because probability of detection changes smoothly with stimulus intensity. The cumulative normal function is used because it relates to the integration of a normal (Gaussian) distribution, mirroring sensory noise properties and providing a mathematically tractable sigmoid curve that fits empirical detection probabilities well.
   **External example:** Cumulative Gaussian functions are frequently applied in visual psychophysics for modeling detection thresholds of visual stimuli. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3767615/

8. **Q:** Describe Stevens’s law (power law) in psychophysics and differentiate between prothetic and metathetic sensory continua identified by Stevens.
   **A:** Stevens’s law states that psychological sensation (S) relates to physical stimulus magnitude (f) by the power function S = Kf^N, where K is a constant and N is an exponent specific to the sensory modality. If N = 1, the relationship is linear; if N < 1, logarithmic; if N > 1, exponential. Stevens distinguished sensory continua as prothetic—those based on additive physiological coding where stimulus intensity varies quantitatively (e.g., brightness, loudness)—and metathetic—those based on qualitative differences or substitution, expressing changes in kind rather than amount (e.g., color or pitch).
   **External example:** Brightness perception follows Stevens’s law with N ≈ 0.33 (compression), illustrating a prothetic continuum, while color perception involves qualitative shifts, illustrating metathetic continua. https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1962-02070-001

9. **Q:** How do adaptive methods like the staircase and PEST procedures improve threshold estimation in psychophysics compared to classical methods?
   **A:** Adaptive methods dynamically adjust stimulus intensity based on observer responses to estimate thresholds efficiently by focusing trials near the threshold level, reducing unnecessary trials at clearly perceivable or imperceptible stimulus values. The staircase method changes stimulus magnitude by fixed steps after reversals in perception, while PEST adjusts step size adaptively based on response patterns to refine threshold estimation. These methods yield accurate thresholds with fewer trials than constant stimuli or method of limits, enhancing experimental efficiency and observer engagement.
   **External example:** The staircase procedure is widely used in clinical audiology to quickly estimate hearing thresholds with fewer patient tests. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5832102/

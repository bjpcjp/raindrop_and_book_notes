This chapter explores the complex processes underlying hearing, including how auditory information is perceptually organized into streams, how listeners localize sounds in space using cues like interaural time and intensity differences, and how music and speech are perceived through specific acoustic and cognitive mechanisms. It also addresses phenomena such as auditory illusions, categorical perception of speech sounds, and the integration of visual cues in language comprehension, highlighting the intricate interplay between physical stimuli and perceptual experience.

Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves graphically represent an observer's sensitivity (dâ€²) by plotting hit rates against false alarm rates, with the curve's distance from the diagonal indicating sensitivity and points along the curve reflecting decision criterion or response bias. Changes in decision criterion, influenced by factors like rewards or punishments, shift a point along the curve without affecting sensitivity, while ROC analysis also tests assumptions of signal detection theory, such as normality and equal variance of signal and noise distributions.

Color perception involves understanding the nature of light, its intensity, wavelength, and spectral composition, as well as the visual system's processing through three perceptual dimensions—hue, brightness, and saturation—and the mechanisms of color mixture including additive and subtractive processes. Theories of color vision integrate trichromatic receptor responses and opponent-process neuronal interactions, while perceptual phenomena such as afterimages, simultaneous contrast, and color constancy illustrate the complex neural and contextual factors influencing how colors are perceived.

Attention is a crucial cognitive process that allows selective focus on specific stimuli amid abundant sensory information, influencing perception through mechanisms such as spatial and temporal preparation, selectivity in visual and auditory modalities, and visual search. Behavioral and experimental studies reveal properties like attentional blindness, inhibition of return, and the attentional blink, while clinical conditions such as hemineglect and Balint syndrome demonstrate the impact of attentional deficits on perception.

The nervous system is divided into the central nervous system, comprising the brain, brainstem, cerebellum, and spinal cord, and the peripheral nervous system, which includes cranial and spinal nerves responsible for transmitting sensory and motor information. Various sensory pathways, such as the spinothalamic and lemniscal systems, carry different types of sensory information to the brain, while modern techniques like EEG, MEG, PET, fMRI, and neuromodulation methods help researchers study brain activity and its role in perception and cognition.

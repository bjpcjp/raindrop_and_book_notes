1. **Q:** What are the main psychophysical capabilities that psychophysics investigates, and how are absolute and difference thresholds operationally defined and estimated?  
   **A:** Psychophysics investigates detecting stimuli, discriminating them, and estimating their value (scaling). The absolute threshold is the smallest amount of energy that can be detected in the absence of any stimulation, operationally defined as the stimulus intensity detected 50% of the time using methods like the method of constant stimuli. The difference threshold (just noticeable difference, JND) is the minimal intensity difference required to distinguish two stimuli, often estimated by having an observer compare a standard to varying comparison stimuli and determining the point where they are perceived as different with 75% probability.  
   **External example:** The absolute threshold for detecting a faint light stimulus is commonly measured using the method of constant stimuli, analyzing psychometric functions to find the intensity detected 50% of the time. (See: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4645369/)

2. **Q:** Explain Signal Detection Theory (SDT) and how it separates sensitivity from decision-making criterion, including the roles of hits, misses, false alarms, and correct rejections. How is sensitivity quantified?  
   **A:** SDT posits that detecting a stimulus involves both sensory sensitivity and decision criteria. A stimulus can be only noise (N) or signal plus noise (S+N). An observer’s decision criterion determines when they report "yes" or "no." Four outcomes arise: hits (signal present & yes), misses (signal present & no), false alarms (signal absent & yes), and correct rejections (signal absent & no). Sensitivity is quantified by d′ (d-prime), calculated as the difference between Z scores of hit and false alarm rates, reflecting sensitivity independent of response bias.  
   **External example:** SDT is used in medical diagnostics, for example, to separate radiologists’ ability to detect tumors (sensitivity) from their decision thresholds affecting false alarms. (See: https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/BF03205245)

3. **Q:** Describe Weber’s Law and its generalization, including the mathematical relationship between the difference threshold and stimulus magnitude, and explain why the law fails at low or high magnitudes.  
   **A:** Weber’s Law states that the ratio of the difference threshold (Δf) to the standard stimulus magnitude (f) is constant (Δf/f = K), meaning the minimal detectable difference increases proportionally with stimulus intensity. Its generalization adds a constant sensory noise term: Δf = Kf + a. This accounts for deviations at low intensities where sensory noise dominates, leading to a larger relative difference threshold, and at very high intensities where the Weber fraction also increases slightly.  
   **External example:** Weber’s Law explains why one can detect a 1-gram difference when holding 10 grams (10%) but needs a larger absolute difference when holding 1 kg; deviations occur near sensory limits. (See: https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/psychology/weber-fraction)

4. **Q:** What are the main methods for estimating sensory thresholds, their operational procedures, and the advantages or limitations of each?  
   **A:** The main methods are:  
   - Method of constant stimuli: fixed stimulus intensities presented randomly; precise but time-consuming.  
   - Method of limits: stimuli presented ascending or descending; faster but prone to anticipation and habituation errors.  
   - Method of adjustment: observer adjusts stimulus to threshold; fastest but least precise and more variable.  
   Adaptive methods like staircase and PEST optimize trial numbers by focusing stimulus values near the threshold.  
   **External example:** Adaptive staircase methods rapidly converge toward auditory thresholds in hearing tests, reducing patient fatigue. (See: https://academic.oup.com/occmed/article/57/5/342/1408619)

5. **Q:** Outline Stevens’s power law for scaling sensory magnitude, its formula, and explain the difference between prothetic and metathetic sensory continua.  
   **A:** Stevens’s power law states that the perceived sensation S relates to physical stimulus magnitude f by S = Kf^N, where K is a constant and N an exponent specific to the sensory modality. N > 1 indicates exponential growth, N = 1 linear, and N < 1 logarithmic. Prothetic continua involve additive physiological processes where sensation magnitude varies quantitatively (e.g., loudness), and metathetic continua involve substitution processes where sensation quality changes (e.g., hue in color perception).  
   **External example:** Loudness perception follows a power law with an exponent ~0.6, illustrating a prothetic continuum. (See: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5308276/)

6. **Q:** Describe the physical characteristics of sound waves, including frequency, amplitude, and the distinctions between simple (pure) and complex sounds, and how the cochlea analyses these sounds.  
   **A:** Sound is vibration causing air pressure variations; frequency (Hz) is cycles per second determining pitch; amplitude (dB) measures pressure intensity determining loudness. Pure tones are simple sine waves of a single frequency. Complex sounds contain multiple frequencies, including fundamental (lowest) and harmonics (integer multiples). The cochlea’s basilar membrane vibrates at different places depending on frequency (place theory) and encodes timing via neural phase locking (frequency/temporal theory). This enables decomposition into components analogous to Fourier analysis.  
   **External example:** The cochlea’s tonotopic organization can be seen in cochlear implant function mimicking frequency-place mapping. (See: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4283627/)

7. **Q:** Explain the key subjective auditory characteristics—pitch, loudness, and timbre—and how these relate to physical sound properties and neural processing.  
   **A:** Pitch corresponds to perception of high or low sound, closely linked with frequency but influenced by intensity. Loudness corresponds to perceived intensity but varies with frequency and duration, measured in sones and phons. Timbre refers to sound quality differences not explained by pitch or loudness, primarily due to harmonic content and envelope, enabling differentiation between instruments playing the same note. Neural encoding of these involves frequency and intensity processing, plus complex spectral integration for timbre.  
   **External example:** Equal-loudness contours illustrate loudness variation across frequencies at the same physical intensity. (See: https://asa.scitation.org/doi/10.1121/1.1916566)

8. **Q:** Describe the main biological structures involved in hearing from the outer ear to the auditory cortex and the specific roles of the cochlea and hair cells in transducing sound.  
   **A:** Sound waves enter via the outer ear (pinna, auditory canal) and vibrate the eardrum. Middle ear ossicles (malleus, incus, stapes) transmit vibrations to the oval window of the cochlea, a fluid-filled spiral structure. The basilar membrane inside the cochlea vibrates with frequency-dependent maxima. Hair cells on the basilar membrane (inner and outer) convert mechanical vibrations into electrical signals via stereocilia deflections. Signals travel via the auditory nerve to the cochlear nucleus, superior olivary complex, inferior colliculus, medial geniculate body, and finally to the primary auditory cortex with tonotopic organization.  
   **External example:** Damage to outer hair cells results in sensorineural hearing loss, a common clinical condition. (See: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK500021/)

9. **Q:** Summarize the frequency (temporal) and place theories of pitch perception and how modern understanding integrates them, including the volley principle and traveling wave.  
   **A:** Frequency theory posits pitch perception is based on the firing rate of auditory neurons matching sound frequency, but is limited by neuronal firing rates (~1000 Hz). The volley principle extends this by distributing firing across groups of neurons for higher frequencies. Place theory states that different places on the basilar membrane respond maximally to different frequencies (tonotopy). Modern understanding integrates both: temporal coding (frequency/volley) predominates for low frequencies (<~1000 Hz), while place coding predominates at higher frequencies.  
   **External example:** Combined temporal and place coding is considered in cochlear implant design to improve pitch perception. (See: https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2015.00172/full)

10. **Q:** Discuss the factors underlying sound localization in humans, including interaural time and intensity differences, the role of the pinna, and challenges in distance perception.  
    **A:** Humans localize sound azimuthally using interaural time difference (ITD) cues most effective for low frequencies and interaural intensity difference (IID) cues for high frequencies due to head shadowing. The pinna provides spectral cues for vertical localization. Distance estimation is more difficult, relying on loudness (inverse square law), ratio of direct to reverberant sound, and frequency-dependent attenuation. Visual information can influence perceived auditory location (ventriloquism effect).  
    **External example:** ITD and IID cues enable accurate horizontal localization in virtual reality audio systems. (See: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1067525)

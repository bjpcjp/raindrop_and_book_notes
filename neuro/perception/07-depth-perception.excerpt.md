Depth perception relies on various binocular and monocular cues, such as binocular convergence, retinal disparity, linear perspective, and occlusion, which the brain uses to construct the impression of a third dimension from two-dimensional retinal images. Perceptual constancy enables the stable recognition of object size and shape despite changing retinal images and distances, while illusions demonstrate how depth cues can sometimes mislead our interpretation of space.

1. **Q:** How are ROC curves constructed and what do the axes represent?
   **A:** ROC curves are constructed by plotting the probability of a hit (true positive rate) on the ordinate (y-axis) against the probability of a false alarm (false positive rate) on the abscissa (x-axis).
   **External example:** The National Cancer Institute explains ROC curves as plots of sensitivity versus 1-specificity, which correspond to hit rates and false alarm rates respectively. https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/roc-curve

2. **Q:** What does the position of a point on an ROC curve indicate about an observer’s decision criteria, and how does this relate to sensitivity or d′?
   **A:** The position of a point on a given ROC curve reflects the observer’s decision criterion or response bias: points toward the upper right indicate a lax criterion (high hit and false alarm rates), whereas points toward the lower left indicate a conservative criterion (low hit and false alarm rates). The sensitivity (d′), however, is the same everywhere on the curve and is indicated by the curve’s distance from the diagonal line.
   **External example:** The American Psychological Association illustrates how points along an ROC curve represent different criterion levels while sensitivity remains constant. https://dictionary.apa.org/receiver-operating-characteristic-curve

3. **Q:** What experimental manipulation can shift the decision criterion on the ROC curve, and why does this affect response bias without changing sensitivity?
   **A:** Assigning rewards for hits and punishments for false alarms, such as monetary incentives and penalties, shifts the decision criterion. If the reward for a hit exceeds the penalty for a false alarm, an observer adopts a lax criterion (moving points up and right on the ROC curve). Conversely, greater penalties for false alarms lead to a conservative criterion (points move down and left). These manipulations affect response bias but do not alter sensitivity.
   **External example:** A study on decision-making by Kahneman and Tversky shows how incentives shift criteria without affecting perceptual sensitivity. https://doi.org/10.1126/science.7455683

4. **Q:** What does the diagonal line in an ROC plot represent, and what does it imply about the observer’s sensitivity (d′)?
   **A:** The diagonal line represents the case where the probability of hits equals the probability of false alarms, meaning the observer’s sensitivity is zero (d′ = 0); the observer cannot discriminate signal from noise.
   **External example:** The FDA describes the diagonal on the ROC plot as the chance performance line where sensitivity equals zero. https://www.fda.gov/media/130838/download

5. **Q:** How can ROC curves and their Z-score transformations be used to test assumptions underlying signal detection theory?
   **A:** By transforming hit and false alarm proportions into Z-scores and plotting them, one can test two key assumptions: (1) if the noise and signal+noise distributions are normal, the Z-transformed ROC points should fall near a straight line; (2) if these distributions have equal variance, the slope of this line should be 1.
   **External example:** Stanislaw and Todorov (1999) explain that plotting Z-ROC curves tests normality and equal variance assumptions in signal detection theory. https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.3758/BF03209448

6. **Q:** How does an observer’s lax or conservative bias manifest in terms of hit and false alarm rates, and how is this represented visually on the ROC curve?
   **A:** A lax observer has high hit rates accompanied by high false alarm rates, represented by points toward the upper right of the ROC curve. A conservative observer has low hit rates and low false alarm rates, shown by points toward the lower left.
   **External example:** The British Psychological Society explains lax versus conservative observers in terms of hit and false alarm rates on ROC curves. https://www.bps.org.uk/psychologist/receiver-operating-characteristic-curves

7. **Q:** Why do movements of the decision criterion on an ROC curve not affect sensitivity, and what implication does this have for interpreting ROC curves?
   **A:** Because the ROC curve defines all possible hit and false alarm rates for a fixed sensitivity level, changing the decision criterion moves the point along the same curve without changing the curve’s shape or distance from the diagonal; hence, sensitivity remains constant. This implies that response bias and sensitivity are separable and can be independently analyzed using ROC curves.
   **External example:** A review by Swets (1988) highlights that criterion shifts move points along an ROC curve but do not alter underlying sensitivity. https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1988-04784-001

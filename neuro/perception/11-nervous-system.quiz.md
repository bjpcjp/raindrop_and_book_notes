1. **Q:** Describe the organizational divisions of the nervous system and explain how the peripheral nervous system components relate to sensory receptors and motor functions.
   **A:** The nervous system is divided into the central nervous system (CNS) and the peripheral nervous system (PNS). The CNS includes the brain, brainstem, cerebellum, and spinal cord, responsible for higher-level processing. The PNS includes the autonomic nervous system (sympathetic and parasympathetic systems) and the somatic nervous system; the somatic system contains nerves that transmit impulses from sensory receptors to the spinal cord and brain and from the brain to muscles. Neurons’ axons bundle as nerves in the PNS, transmitting nerve impulses crucial to sensation and motor response.

2. **Q:** Compare and contrast the spinothalamic and lemniscal systems in terms of their pathways, crossing points, and types of sensory information transmitted.
   **A:** The spinothalamic system crosses from one side of the body to the contralateral side immediately upon entering the spinal cord and transmits diffuse sensations like tickling, itching, pain, and temperature via the anterolateral part of the spinal cord directly towards the thalamus, then to the somatosensory cortex. The lemniscal system (dorsal column system) transmits sensations such as vibration, fine touch, body position, and friction; it crosses at the bulb (medulla) level, before synapsing in the thalamus, and ascends via posterior spinal cord columns.

3. **Q:** What are the major divisions of the central nervous system and what key brain structures do they encompass?
   **A:** The CNS major divisions include the encephalon (brain + brainstem + cerebellum) and spinal cord. The brain comprises the cerebral cortex (telencephalon), limbic system, thalamus, and hypothalamus (diencephalon). The brainstem includes the midbrain (mesencephalon), pons (metencephalon), and bulb (myelencephalon). The cerebellum and spinal cord are also CNS components. The forebrain consists of the telencephalon and diencephalon; the midbrain equals mesencephalon, and the hindbrain comprises pons, bulb, and cerebellum.

4. **Q:** Explain the functional specialization and anatomical location of key cortical areas involved in sensory processing as described in the document.
   **A:** The cerebral cortex contains specialized areas for sensory and motor functions. The motor cortex and premotor cortex lie anterior to the central fissure, while the somatosensory cortex is just posterior, divided into primary (receiving receptor organ input directly) and secondary areas (receiving processed input). The auditory cortex is in the temporal lobe, and visual cortex divisions are in the occipital lobe at the cortex’s posterior. The central and lateral fissures help locate these lobes and areas.

5. **Q:** Discuss the modern neuroimaging and neuromodulation methods used for studying brain function, including their principles, temporal/spatial resolutions, and applications in sensory and cognitive research.
   **A:** EEG uses scalp electrodes to measure electrical brain activity with high temporal but moderate spatial resolution; evoked potentials are a specific EEG analysis for time-locking stimuli to brain responses. MEG captures magnetic fields generated by brain activity with good temporal and better spatial resolution than EEG. PET uses radioactive tracers to measure metabolic activity, offering good spatial but poor temporal resolution. fMRI, based on metabolic changes and blood flow, provides high spatial resolution without radiation. Neuromodulation includes TMS, which temporarily disrupts brain areas using magnetic pulses, and tDCS, which modulates synaptic transmission via low current electrical stimulation through anode/cathode electrodes.

6. **Q:** Describe the relationship between dermatome organization and spinal nerve classification including the functional implication for sensory innervation.
   **A:** Spinal nerves are classified by spinal level into cervical (1–8), thoracic (1–12), lumbar (1–5), sacral (1–5), and coccygeal (1). Each spinal nerve innervates a specific segmented skin region called a dermatome. This organized innervation means sensory input from a defined skin band corresponds to a specific spinal nerve, facilitating diagnosis of nerve damage or neurological function.

7. **Q:** How do the differing synapse locations and crossing points in the spinothalamic and lemniscal pathways impact the processing and perception of somatosensory information?
   **A:** In the spinothalamic system, crossing occurs immediately at the spinal cord entry, allowing rapid relay of pain, temperature, and diffuse touch to the contralateral thalamus and cortex, supporting fast protective responses. The lemniscal system crosses only at the bulb, enabling finer discrimination of vibration, fine touch, and proprioception by maintaining ipsilateral precision longer before integration, thus supporting detailed somatosensory perception.

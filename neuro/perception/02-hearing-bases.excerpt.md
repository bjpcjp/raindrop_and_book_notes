Hearing involves translating air pressure variations caused by vibrations into neural signals processed by the brain, with sound characterized physically by frequency, amplitude, and complexity, and perceived subjectively through pitch, loudness, and timbre. The auditory system comprises the outer, middle, and inner ear, where mechanical vibrations are converted into electrical impulses in the cochlea and transmitted via auditory pathways to the brain, with hearing perception explained by both frequency and place theories, while hearing loss can result from mechanical transmission issues or sensorineural damage, often exacerbated by noise exposure or aging.

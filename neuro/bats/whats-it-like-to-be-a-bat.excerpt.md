Thomas Nagel's essay "What Is It Like to Be a Bat?" argues that consciousness presents a unique challenge to the mind-body problem because subjective experience—what it is like to be a particular organism—is inherently tied to a specific point of view and cannot be fully understood or reduced through objective physical explanations. He emphasizes that this subjective character of experience defies existing reductive analyses and calls for a new objective phenomenology to better comprehend the nature of consciousness in terms accessible beyond imagination or empathy.

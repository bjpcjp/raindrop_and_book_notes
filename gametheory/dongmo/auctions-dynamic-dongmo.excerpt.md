Dynamic auction procedures converge to a Walrasian equilibrium if each buyer's valuation satisfies the gross substitutes (GS) condition, which ensures demand stability when prices increase. Furthermore, the double-track auction algorithm extends convergence guarantees to valuations satisfying the gross substitutes and complements (GSC) condition by adjusting prices in two item categories, achieving polynomial-time convergence to equilibrium.

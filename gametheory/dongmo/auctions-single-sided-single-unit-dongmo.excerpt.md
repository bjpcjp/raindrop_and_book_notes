Single-sided single-unit auctions involve an auctioneer selling a single good to multiple bidders, with common formats including English, Dutch, first-price sealed-bid, and second-price sealed-bid (Vickrey) auctions, each having distinct procedures and characteristics. Under the independent private values model, the Revenue Equivalence Theorem states that these standard auction types yield the same expected revenue when the highest bidder wins and the lowest-value bidder expects zero utility.

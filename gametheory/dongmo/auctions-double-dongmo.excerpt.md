A double auction is a market mechanism allowing buyers and sellers to submit bids and asks simultaneously, with transactions occurring when bid prices meet or exceed ask prices, and clearing prices set within the bid-ask range. Market design involves defining policies for accepting, matching, pricing, clearing, and charging, while tradersâ€™ utilities depend on the difference between private values and clearing prices, and various bidding strategies influence market outcomes.

Combinatorial auctions involve selling multiple items simultaneously where bidders can place bids on bundles of items, with valuations that may reflect complementarities or substitutabilities between items. The challenge lies in efficiently allocating items to buyers to maximize total value, often addressed through concepts like efficient allocation and Walrasian equilibrium, where price vectors and allocation align to achieve optimal distribution.

Early Internet advertising transitioned from inefficient, per-impression banner ads to more sophisticated sponsored search auctions, with Google's Generalized Second-Price (GSP) auction introduced in 2002 enabling advertisers to bid for ad positions and pay based on the next highest bid, promoting greater revenue and stability despite not being a truth-telling mechanism. The GSP auction addresses weaknesses of first-price auctions by encouraging an envy-free equilibrium, balancing strategic bidding and payoff optimization among advertisers.

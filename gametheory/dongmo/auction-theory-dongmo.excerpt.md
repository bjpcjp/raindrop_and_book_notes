This tutorial by A/Prof Dongmo Zhang provides a comprehensive overview of auction mechanisms from artificial intelligence perspectives, covering single-sided auctions, double auctions, combinatorial and dynamic auctions, as well as ad auctions and market simulation. It discusses fundamental theories like the Revenue Equivalence Theorem, practical applications in electronic markets, and experimental platforms such as the Trading Agent Competition to illustrate auction design and strategy complexities.

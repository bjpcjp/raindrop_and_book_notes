The GameTheory package for Macaulay2 provides tools to compute and analyze four equilibrium concepts in finite normal-form games—Nash, correlated, dependency, and conditional independence equilibria—using algebraic and combinatorial frameworks. It enables the construction of payoff tensors, equilibrium ideals, and polyhedral models, offering new theoretical insights and computational methods for studying game-theoretic equilibria.

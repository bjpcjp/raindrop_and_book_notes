- **Approximate mechanism** — A mechanism that introduces approximations or restrictions to make computation or communication feasible, potentially affecting economic properties like strategyproofness.

- **Ascending-price auction** — An iterative auction where prices are increased progressively, and bidders respond with bids at current prices; may implement efficient outcomes such as VCG.

- **Bayesian-Nash equilibrium** — A solution concept where each agent maximizes expected utility given beliefs about other agents’ types and strategies.

- **Bid structure** — Defines the format and constraints of bids in an auction, such as price-quantity pairs, bundled bids, XOR bids, or multiattribute bids.

- **Budget-balance (BB)** — A mechanism property where total payments sum to zero (strong) or are non-negative (weak).

- **Coalitional value** — The value of an efficient allocation across a subset (coalition) of agents.

- **Combinatorial auction** — An auction allowing bidders to express valuations on bundles of items rather than only individual items.

- **Competitive equilibrium (CE)** — A state in which allocation and prices satisfy complementary slackness conditions, so supply equals demand and all agents optimize utility given prices.

- **Confidentiality** — Assumption or requirement that agents’ valuations or private information is not fully disclosed unless necessary.

- **Configurability (multiattribute auctions)** — Allowing bids to specify multiple attributes (quality, delivery, etc.) with preferences over attribute combinations.

- **Direct-revelation mechanism (DRM)** — A mechanism where agents directly report their types (preferences, valuations) to the mechanism.

- **Efficient mechanism design** — Designing mechanisms to maximize total surplus or valuations of all agents.

- **Ex post individual rationality (IR)** — Agents have non-negative payoff after outcome realization, regardless of others' types.

- **Exclusive-or (XOR) bidding language** — A bidding format where at most one bid among a set can be accepted by the mechanism.

- **Game-theoretic agent model** — Agents modeled as rational, utility-maximizing, strategic players aware of other agents’ strategies and types.

- **Groves mechanism** — A family of incentive-compatible and efficient mechanisms where payments align agents' incentives with overall efficiency.

- **Information feedback** — The process by which auction participants receive information about current prices and allocations to adjust bids.

- **Individual rationality (IR)** — Agents prefer participating in the mechanism to opting out (expected payoff ≥ 0).

- **Indirect mechanism** — Mechanisms in which agents submit partial or incremental information; bidding proceeds iteratively with feedback.

- **Incentive compatibility (IC)** — Agents’ best response is to truthfully report their private information.

- **Integrality** — A property of linear programs where relaxation solutions remain integer-valued, enabling efficient winner determination.

- **Matching supply to demand** — Winner-determination or market clearing process that pairs buyers and sellers in an auction.

- **Marginal-decreasing valuations** — Valuations where the utility or value decreases with additional units (decreasing marginal utility).

- **Market structure** — The arrangement of buyers and sellers in an auction, e.g., forward, reverse, or double auctions.

- **Multiattribute auction** — Auctions where goods are differentiated by several attributes and preferences are over attribute bundles.

- **Multiunit auction** — Auction for multiple identical units of the same item where agents have preferences over quantities.

- **Myopic best-response (MBR)** — Agents responding optimally to current prices ignoring future price dynamics, often a practical equilibrium assumption.

- **Non-anonymous prices** — Pricing that varies across agents for the same item or bundle, e.g., personalized pricing.

- **NP-hard** — Computational complexity class indicating that a problem is at least as hard as the hardest problems in NP; no known polynomial algorithm.

- **Partial revelation** — Agents reveal preferences incrementally rather than fully upfront, reducing communication and computation.

- **Paypal mechanism (VCG variant)** — Not explicitly named as Paypal in the text, but VCG payments involve paying the externality imposed on others (related to Groves mechanisms).

- **Price-taking model** — Agent model where agents accept prices as given and optimize locally without strategic manipulation.

- **Primal-dual algorithm** — Optimization technique designing auctions that maintain feasible primal and dual solutions, converging to equilibrium.

- **Private value model** — Model where an agent’s valuation depends solely on its private information, independent of others’ valuations.

- **Proxy auction (ascending-proxy auction)** — Auction variant where bidders submit preferences to proxy agents who bid on their behalf iteratively.

- **Public good** — Not explicitly defined here but generally, goods that are non-excludable and non-rivalrous.

- **Reservation price** — Minimum (or maximum) acceptable price for a buyer or seller, serving as a constraint in auctions.

- **Revenue equivalence** — The theorem stating that many efficient, incentive-compatible auction formats yield the same expected revenue.

- **Strategyproofness** — Strong incentive compatibility where truthful reporting is the dominant strategy regardless of others’ actions.

- **Substitutes condition (gross substitutes)** — A property of valuations ensuring that demand for an item does not decrease when prices of other items increase, enabling CE prices.

- **Universal competitive equilibrium (UCE) prices** — Prices that form CE for all submarkets formed by removing any single agent; used to compute VCG payments.

- **VCG mechanism (Vickrey-Clarke-Groves)** — A Groves mechanism that maximizes total value and sets payments to internalize externalities; widely used in efficient auctions.

- **Winner determination problem** — Computational problem of selecting the set of winning bids that maximize total value or minimize total cost under constraints.

- **XOR bidding language** — See Exclusive-or; allows expressing mutually exclusive bids.

- **Zig-zag bidding languages** — Not mentioned explicitly; likely a variant or logical combination bidding languages.

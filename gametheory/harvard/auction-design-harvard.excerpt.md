This chapter provides a comprehensive overview of auction mechanisms, focusing on their classification, economic properties, and implementation complexities. It emphasizes the interplay between incentive compatibility, computational challenges, and the design of indirect mechanisms, illustrating these concepts through various auction types including combinatorial, multi-unit, and multiattribute auctions.

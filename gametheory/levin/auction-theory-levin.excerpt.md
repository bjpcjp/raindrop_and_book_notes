Auction theory analyzes bidding strategies and expected revenues in various auction formats, including independent private value and common value models, highlighting key results like revenue equivalence across diverse auction types and the impact of information aggregation in large auctions. Notably, in independent private value settings, first-price and second-price auctions yield the same expected revenue, while in common value auctions, bidders must account for the winner's curse, and information aggregation depends on specific conditions related to the number of bidders and items.

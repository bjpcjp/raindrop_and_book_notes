The chapter explores the prisoners' dilemma game, emphasizing its paradox where dominant strategies lead to worse collective outcomes, and examines solutions including repeated play, penalty schemes, and leadership roles. It details how strategies like tit-for-tat can sustain cooperation in infinitely repeated games, discusses experimental evidence of such behavior, and presents real-world examples from economics, biology, and international policy to illustrate the dilemmaâ€™s broad applicability and potential resolutions.

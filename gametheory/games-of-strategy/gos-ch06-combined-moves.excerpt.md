This chapter explores games combining sequential and simultaneous moves, illustrating how such games are analyzed using both game trees with rollback equilibrium and payoff tables with Nash equilibria. It also examines how changing the order and timing of moves—from simultaneous to sequential and vice versa—affects game outcomes, introduces the concept of subgames and subgame-perfect equilibrium, and extends these ideas to games with more than two players.

- **Asymmetric information** — A situation in a game where one player has more or better information than another, leading to strategic manipulation like signaling and screening.  
- **Coalitions** — Alliances formed among three or more players in a constant-sum or zero-sum game to cooperate against others.  
- **Constant-sum game** — A game where the total gains and losses among players sum to a constant value; often used interchangeably with zero-sum game.  
- **Cooperative game** — A game in which agreements to coordinate joint actions are enforceable by external parties, facilitating collective strategies.  
- **Decision** — An action choice situation without strategic interaction; players decide independently without concern for others' responses.  
- **Equilibrium** — A state where each player uses a strategy that is the best response to the strategies of the other players.  
- **Expected payoff** — The weighted average of payoffs over all possible outcomes of a game, with weights equal to the probabilities of each outcome.  
- **Evolutionary game** — An approach where strategies evolve over time based on their success, analogous to biological evolution and natural selection.  
- **External uncertainty** — Uncertainty about factors outside the game, such as environmental variables or external circumstances affecting payoffs.  
- **Game** — A strategic interaction involving two or more mutually aware players whose choices influence each other's outcomes.  
- **Imperfect information** — Games in which players do not have complete information about the moves or payoffs of other players, including both external and strategic uncertainty.  
- **Information set** — A formal concept defining the knowledge a player has at a particular decision point; relevant for perfect or imperfect information games.  
- **Mixed strategy** — A strategy involving randomization over available pure strategies to prevent predictability.  
- **Mutual awareness** — The recognition by players that their actions affect each other and that each knows the others recognize this as well, creating strategic complexity.  
- **Noncooperative game** — A game where enforceable joint agreements are not possible and each player acts independently, pursuing their own interests.  
- **Payoff** — A numerical representation of the value or utility a player receives from a particular outcome of the game.  
- **Perfect information** — A game setting where all players know all previous moves and payoffs, and there is no uncertainty about actions taken.  
- **Predator-prey game** — Example of strategic interaction in biology where evolutionary game theory applies (implied in evolutionary games).  
- **Rational behavior** — Players act consistently to maximize their own payoffs, with full knowledge of their preferences and flawless calculation of best strategies.  
- **Screening** — Strategies or actions designed by a less-informed player to elicit private information from a more-informed player.  
- **Screening device** — An action or mechanism that forces a more-informed player to reveal information credibly.  
- **Sequential moves** — A game structure where players take turns moving one after another, allowing for reaction to prior moves.  
- **Signaling** — Actions by a more-informed player intended to credibly convey private information to others.  
- **Simultaneous moves** — A game structure where players move at the same time, without knowledge of other players’ current decisions.  
- **Strategic game** — A game in which players are mutually aware that their actions influence each other and respond accordingly.  
- **Strategic uncertainty** — A type of imperfect information where a player is unsure of others’ current or past moves.  
- **Strategy** — A complete plan of action for every possible situation in a game, specifying what moves a player will take.  
- **Zero-sum game** — A game in which one player’s gain is exactly equal to the other players’ losses; total payoff sums to zero.

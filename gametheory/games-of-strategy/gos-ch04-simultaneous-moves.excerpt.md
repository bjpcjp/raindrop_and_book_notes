Simultaneous-move games are strategic interactions where players choose actions without knowing rivals' choices, often depicted with game tables listing discrete pure strategies and payoffs. The Nash equilibrium concept, where each player's strategy is the best response to the others', is introduced as the fundamental solution concept, with dominance and best-response analysis as key tools to identify equilibria, including cases with multiple players and multiple equilibria.

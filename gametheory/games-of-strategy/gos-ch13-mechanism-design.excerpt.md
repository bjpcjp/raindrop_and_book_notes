Mechanism design studies how a less-informed player (the principal) can devise rules or incentive schemes to align the actions of a more-informed player (the agent) with the principalâ€™s goals, addressing problems caused by asymmetric information. Applications include price discrimination, procurement contracts, and incentivizing employee effort, where the principal maximizes their own objective subject to incentive-compatibility and participation constraints of the agent.

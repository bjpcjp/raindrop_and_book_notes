Collective-action games involve numerous players whose individual incentives often lead to socially suboptimal outcomes, such as prisoners’ dilemmas, chicken, and assurance games, where benefits and costs depend on others’ participation. The chapter examines the nature of such games, the impact of spillover effects or externalities on individual and social payoffs, and discusses possible solutions including norms, sanctions, communication, leadership, and coordination to improve collective outcomes.

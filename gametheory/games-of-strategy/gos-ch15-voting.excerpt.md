This chapter explores various voting procedures—including binary, plurative, and mixed methods—and the strategic behavior of voters and candidates, highlighting how different systems can produce paradoxical or unexpected outcomes. It also discusses the median voter theorem, which explains why, in two-candidate elections, both candidates tend to position themselves at the preference point of the median voter to maximize electoral success.

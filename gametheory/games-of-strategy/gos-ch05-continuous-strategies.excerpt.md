This chapter extends simultaneous-move game analysis to continuous strategy spaces, illustrating how best-response functions can be used to find Nash equilibria in settings like pricing competition and political advertising. It also critically examines the Nash equilibrium concept, discussing its limitations related to risk, multiplicity of equilibria, and rationality assumptions, and reviews empirical evidence from laboratory and real-world contexts that often support but sometimes challenge the conceptâ€™s predictive power.

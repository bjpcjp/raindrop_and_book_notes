Auctions are competitive bidding mechanisms used to sell goods and services, with various types such as English, Dutch, first-price sealed-bid, and second-price sealed-bid (Vickrey) auctions, each differing in bidding rules and strategic considerations. Seller revenue depends on bidder risk attitudes and valuation estimates, with key phenomena including the winnerâ€™s curse in common-value auctions and incentives for truthful bidding in second-price auctions.

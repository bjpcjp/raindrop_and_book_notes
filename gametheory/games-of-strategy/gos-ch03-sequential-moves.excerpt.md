Sequential-move games involve a strict order of play where players take turns making decisions, anticipating future moves and consequences through backward induction or rollback analysis using game trees that display nodes, branches, and payoffs. This method identifies optimal strategies and equilibrium outcomes, as exemplified in various games including the Survivor TV show scenario, illustrating how players consider future responses, commitment advantages, and strategic manipulation of move order.

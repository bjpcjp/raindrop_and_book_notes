Evolutionary game theory models behavior as genetically predetermined strategies (phenotypes) whose success or fitness depends on interactions within and across species, with fitter types proliferating over time to shape population dynamics and stable configurations. These evolutionary stable strategies (ESSs) correspond to Nash equilibria in rational game theory, explaining the emergence and stability of behaviors such as cooperation, defection, and altruism without assuming conscious rationality.

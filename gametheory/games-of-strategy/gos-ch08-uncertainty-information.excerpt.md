This chapter explores how uncertainty and informational limitations arise in games, focusing on strategies individuals and societies use to cope with imperfect information from external uncertainty or risk, such as diversification and pooling. It also examines how asymmetric information affects strategic interactions, emphasizing the roles of signaling and screening in conveying or eliciting private information and how these concepts explain phenomena across economics, biology, and daily social interactions.

- **game tree** — Node and branch representation of sequential moves and their outcomes in a game.  
- **hawk–dove game** — Evolutionary game modeling conflict between aggressive and submissive strategies.  
- **imperfect information** — Game where players do not observe all prior moves or chance events fully.  
- **incentive-compatibility constraint** — Condition that agents prefer to reveal true types or take truthful actions.  
- **information set** — Set of indistinguishable nodes where a player chooses the same action under imperfect information.

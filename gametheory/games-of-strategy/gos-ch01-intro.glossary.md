- **Art of game playing** — The intuitive or experiential aspect of strategy that complements the scientific principles of game theory.  
- **Asymmetries of information** — Situations where some players have private or better information than others in a game.  
- **Backward reasoning** — Thinking ahead to future moves and then reasoning backward to decide the best current action.  
- **Binary choice** — A decision between two alternatives, such as whether to do the shopping or not.  
- **Brinkmanship** — A strategic game where players escalate mutual risk, testing each other’s tolerance for disaster before conceding.  
- **Case study approach** — Learning strategy through specific examples or cases to illustrate concepts.  
- **Chicken (game)** — A strategic game where two players move towards disaster, and the first to yield loses, while mutual yielding or mutual defiance have different outcomes.

- **Evolutionary games** — Strategic situations analyzed in biology and economics to understand how strategies evolve over time.  
- **Focal point** — A commonly expected solution or strategy that helps players coordinate in games with multiple equilibria.  
- **Information manipulation** — The strategic use of actions to convey or conceal private information in interactions.  
- **Makeup exam strategy** — A context illustrating the use of backward reasoning and anticipating opponents’ moves (example story).  
- **Mixed strategy** — Randomizing over possible actions to prevent an opponent from predicting one’s moves.  
- **No-excuses policy** — A commitment by professors or others to refuse exceptions to rules to prevent exploitation.

- **Rational behavior** — Acting logically to maximize one’s own objectives while considering constraints and available information.  
- **Screening device** — A strategy used to induce others to reveal their private information credibly.  
- **Sequential game** — A game where players make moves one after another, observing previous actions.  
- **Signal** — An action taken to credibly convey private information about oneself to another player.

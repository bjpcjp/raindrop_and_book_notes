This chapter discusses simultaneous-move games that lack pure-strategy Nash equilibria, focusing on mixed strategies where players randomize their choices with certain probabilities to keep opponents indifferent and unpredictable. It covers methods for calculating mixed-strategy equilibria in both zero-sum and non-zero-sum games, explores their interpretations and properties, and examines empirical evidence showing that professional players in contexts like tennis and soccer often approximate these theoretical equilibrium mixtures.

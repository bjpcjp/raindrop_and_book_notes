Strategic moves are actions taken by players to alter the rules or order of play in a game to gain an advantage, classified as commitments, threats, or promises, and their effectiveness depends critically on their credibility, which must be established through irreversibility, observability, and sometimes ancillary actions or reputation. These moves change opponents' expectations and can deter or compel certain behaviors, but credibility is often challenging to achieve and requires careful strategic design, including devices like reputation-building, delegation, contracts, and sometimes brinkmanship.

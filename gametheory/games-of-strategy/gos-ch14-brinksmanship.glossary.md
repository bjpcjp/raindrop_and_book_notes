- **acceptability condition** — The upper limit on the probability of war (risk) that a player finds tolerable in making a probabilistic threat, ensuring the threat is affordable to the threatener.

- **brinkmanship** — The strategy of deliberately creating and escalating a probabilistic threat by relinquishing some control over the outcome, exposing both players to increasing risk of mutual harm to compel or deter an opponent.

- **chicken in real time** — A dynamic interpretation of the chicken game where players’ choices involve timing and gradual escalation, increasing the risk of mutual destruction as they approach a confrontation.

- **controlled loss of control** — The deliberate act of relinquishing some freedom over future actions to make a threat credible, while maintaining enough influence to prevent uncontrollable escalation.

- **effectiveness condition** — The minimum probability of harmful action (e.g., war) in a probabilistic threat that is sufficient to compel or deter an opponent.

- **game tree** — A representation of a sequential game showing the order of moves, choices available to players, and their payoffs at each possible outcome.

- **information set** — In an extensive-form game, a set of decision nodes among which a player cannot distinguish and thus must choose the same action at all nodes in the set.

- **probabilistic threat** — A strategic threat where the harmful action occurs with some probability less than one, often created by committing to a randomizing device to maintain credibility without complete certainty of carrying out the threat.

- **pure threat** — A threat with certainty that a harmful action will be taken if the opponent does not comply.

- **risk of errors** — The possibility that a threat may fail to achieve its purpose or that the harmful action may occur accidentally, affecting the size and implementation of the threat.

- **subgame-perfect equilibrium** — A refinement of Nash equilibrium applicable to sequential games, where players’ strategies constitute a Nash equilibrium in every subgame.

- **threat** — A response rule in a game that imposes a cost on both the player making it and the player it aims to influence, intended to compel or deter opponent’s action.

- **U.S.–USSR brinkmanship game** — A simplified game-theoretic model of the Cuban missile crisis representing the strategic interaction between the United States and the Soviet Union involving threats, compliance, and nuclear war risk.

This chapter introduces the basics of strategic games, distinguishing them from individual decisions by the mutual awareness and interaction of players whose actions affect one another, and classifies games along key dimensions such as timing of moves, conflict of interests, repetition, information availability, rule manipulability, and enforceability of agreements. It also outlines fundamental concepts including strategies, payoffs, rationality, and equilibrium, discusses the uses of game theory for explanation, prediction, and prescription, and previews the structure and focus of the subsequent chapters in the book.

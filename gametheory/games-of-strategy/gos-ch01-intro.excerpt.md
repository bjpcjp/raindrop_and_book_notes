Game theory is the science of rational behavior in interactive situations where multiple decision makers anticipate and respond to each other's actions, providing general principles to improve strategic thinking across various real-life contexts. Through examples like sports, negotiations, and social dilemmas, the text illustrates fundamental strategic concepts such as unpredictability, cooperation challenges, communication of intentions, and commitment, which are systematically analyzed and applied throughout the book.

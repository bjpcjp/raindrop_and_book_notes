Game theory, pioneered by mathematicians such as von Neumann, Nash, and Shapley, provides a formal language to analyze interactive situations where multiple players make decisions affecting each other, with applications spanning economics, social sciences, and beyond. This book focuses on non-cooperative game theory, covering foundational concepts like strategic-form games, dominance relations, Nash equilibrium, and advanced topics such as knowledge, belief, and incomplete information, illustrating these with examples such as second-price auctions and the pivotal mechanism.

- **Assessment** — A pair (σ, µ) consisting of a profile of behavioral strategies (σ) and a system of beliefs (µ) specifying, for every information set, the beliefs about the past moves when that information set is reached.

- **Behavioral strategy** — A strategy specifying a probability distribution over the choices available to a player at each of their information sets.

- **Bayesian updating** — The rule that updates beliefs at reached information sets using conditional probabilities derived from the strategy profile σ.

- **Decision node** — A point in the extensive-form game where a player must make a choice.

- **Extensive-form game** — A representation of a sequential game specifying the order of moves, actions available at each decision node, information sets, and payoffs at terminal nodes.

- **Information set** — A collection of decision nodes indistinguishable to the moving player when making a choice; the player does not know which node within the set they are at.

- **Node (decision node)** — A vertex in the game tree where a player makes a move.

- **Payoff function (πi)** — A function assigning a real number payoff to player i at every terminal node of the game tree.

- **Probability distribution over nodes (µ)** — Beliefs assigned over the nodes within an information set that reflect the player's conjecture about the game history.

- **Proot,σ (x)** — The probability that node x is reached from the root when the behavioral strategy profile σ is followed.

- **Proot,σ (H)** — The probability that an information set H is reached when the strategy profile σ is followed; the sum over the probabilities of all nodes in H.

- **Sequential rationality** — A property of a behavioral strategy σi for player i such that at every information set H of i, the choices prescribed by σi maximize expected payoff given beliefs µ and strategies of other players.

- **Sequentially rational strategy** — A player's strategy that maximizes expected payoffs at every information set, considering future optimal choices.

- **Strategy profile (σ)** — An assignment of strategies to all players in the game.

- **Subgame-perfect equilibrium** — A refinement of Nash equilibrium requiring that players’ strategies form a Nash equilibrium in every subgame.

- **Terminal node (Z)** — A node in the extensive form where the game ends and payoffs are assigned.

- **Weak sequential equilibrium** — An assessment (σ, µ) where σ is sequentially rational and beliefs µ satisfy Bayesian updating at all reached information sets.

- **Updating beliefs** — The process of revising the beliefs µ at an information set by conditioning on the strategies played and the nodes reached.

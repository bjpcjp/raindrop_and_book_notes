This chapter discusses general dynamic games characterized by imperfect information, defining extensive forms with information sets to model playersâ€™ uncertainties and perfect recall. It introduces strategies as contingent plans over information sets, defines subgames and subgame-perfect equilibria as refinements of Nash equilibria, and examines games with chance moves modeled by Nature, illustrating solution concepts through examples and exercises.

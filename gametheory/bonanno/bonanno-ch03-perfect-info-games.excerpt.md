This chapter explores finite extensive-form games with perfect information, where players sequentially make decisions fully aware of all prior moves, represented via rooted directed trees. It introduces backward induction as a solution method that identifies strategy profiles corresponding to Nash equilibria and discusses its application and limitations, particularly in two-player games including win-lose and draw outcomes, concluding with various illustrative examples and exercises.

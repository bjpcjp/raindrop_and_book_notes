- **CK (Common Knowledge operator)** — A function mapping an event E to the set of states where E is common knowledge among all individuals; defined as \( CKE = \{ w \in W : I_{CK}(w) \subseteq E \} \).

- **CKE (Event that E is common knowledge)** — The set of states at which event E is common knowledge among all individuals.

- **Common knowledge** — An event E is common knowledge at state w if everyone knows E, everyone knows that everyone knows E, and so on ad infinitum; formally characterized by the common knowledge partition.

- **Common knowledge information partition** — A partition of the state space W obtained by grouping states reachable from each other through sequences passing via individuals’ information sets; used to identify common knowledge.

- **Event** — A subset of the state space W; represents a proposition that may or may not hold at a given state.

- **Information partition (for an individual)** — A partition of the set of states W representing an individual's possible knowledge, where each element (information set) consists of all states the individual cannot distinguish between.

- **Information set** — An element of an information partition; a collection of states indistinguishable to the individual at her decision point.

- **Interactive knowledge** — Knowledge involving multiple agents; includes not only what each agent knows but what they know about other agents’ knowledge.

- **Knowledge** — For an individual at a state w, the individual knows event E if her information set at w is fully contained in E (i.e., \( I(w) \subseteq E \)).

- **Knowledge operator (K)** — A function mapping an event E to the event \( KE = \{ w \in W : I(w) \subseteq E \} \), the set of states where the individual knows E.

- **Monotonicity (Knowledge property)** — If event E implies event F (i.e., \( E \subseteq F \)), then knowing E implies knowing F.

- **Negative introspection (Knowledge property)** — If an individual does not know event E at a state, then she knows that she does not know E.

- **Positive introspection (Knowledge property)** — If an individual knows event E at a state, then she knows that she knows E.

- **Reachability (between states)** — State \( w' \) is reachable from state w if there exists a finite sequence of states connecting w to \( w' \) such that consecutive states are in the same individual’s information set.

- **State** — A complete description of relevant facts about the world; an element of the finite state space W.

- **Truth (Knowledge property)** — If an individual knows event E at a state w, then E is true at w (i.e., \( KE \subseteq E \)).

- **¬G (Complement event)** — The complement of event G, i.e., all states where G is not true.

- **¬KG (Event 'agent does not know G')** — The set of states where the individual does not know G; i.e., where \( I(w) \not\subseteq G \).

- **K¬G (Event 'agent knows not G')** — The set of states where the individual knows that G is false; i.e., where \( I(w) \subseteq \neg G \).

- **Singleton information set** — An information set containing exactly one state; indicates complete knowledge of the true state.

- **Subset relation in knowledge** — For events E and F, knowledge operators satisfy \( KE \subseteq KF \) if \( E \subseteq F \).

- **Uncertainty / not knowing an event** — At states where the individual’s information set includes both states in event E and outside E, the individual does not know that event E holds.

- **W (Set of states)** — The finite set encompassing all possible states, each representing a complete description of the world relevant to the game or scenario.

The chapter introduces the notion of sequential equilibrium, a refinement of subgame-perfect equilibrium that ensures both sequential rationality and consistency of beliefs, even at unreached information sets, by requiring beliefs to be limits of Bayesian-updated beliefs derived from completely mixed strategy profiles. Despite its technical complexity and interpretative challenges, sequential equilibrium eliminates strictly dominated strategies but not weakly dominated ones, motivating further refinements like Perfect Bayesian Equilibrium and trembling-hand perfect equilibrium.

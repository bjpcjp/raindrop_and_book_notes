This document provides a comprehensive exploration of game theory, covering fundamental concepts such as games with ordinal and cardinal payoffs, dynamic and incomplete information games, knowledge and beliefs, rationality, and equilibrium refinements. It systematically presents theoretical frameworks, solution concepts, and exercises across these topics, structured into five parts that delve into strategic interactions, belief formation, and informational aspects within game-theoretic models.

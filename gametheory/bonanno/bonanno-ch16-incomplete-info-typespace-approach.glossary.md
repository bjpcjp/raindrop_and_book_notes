- **Bayesian game of incomplete information** — A static game model where players have types representing private information, including payoffs and beliefs about others, and may not know the entire game structure.

- **Beliefs** — Probability distributions associated with a player's type over the types of other players, representing uncertainty about others.

- **Cell (of a partition)** — A subset of states in a player's information partition where the player cannot distinguish between those states.

- **Common knowledge of rationality** — A situation where all players are rational, all know that all are rational, and so on ad infinitum.

- **Common prior** — A probability distribution over type profiles from which all players’ beliefs can be derived by conditioning on their own type.

- **Conversion (state-space to type-space)** — The procedure of mapping states to type profiles by associating each player’s information set with a unique type and deriving beliefs from state probabilities.

- **Conversion (type-space to state-space)** — The procedure of creating states from type profiles, defining players’ information partitions by their types, and beliefs from the type-space structure.

- **Dynamic game with imperfect information** — A game where the structure includes sequential moves and some players may not perfectly observe past actions.

- **Extensive-form game (with imperfect information)** — A representation of a game specifying the order of moves, actions at each node, information sets reflecting imperfect information, and utilities.

- **Harsanyi consistency** — The condition that players’ types’ beliefs arise from a common prior via conditioning.

- **Harsanyi transformation** — The method of converting a game of incomplete information into an extensive-form game with imperfect but complete information by introducing Nature’s moves that assign types.

- **Information set (Player i)** — A set of states (or nodes) indistinguishable to Player i, i.e., the player’s knowledge partition cell containing a given state.

- **Interactive knowledge-belief structure** — A framework modeling players’ knowledge and beliefs about states and other players’ knowledge.

- **Kripke structure** — A model from modal logic representing possible worlds, accessibility relations, and knowledge; interactive Kripke structures extend this to multi-agent settings.

- **Model** — An interactive knowledge-belief structure augmented by specifying an action for each player at every state.

- **Payoff function (utility function)** — A von Neumann-Morgenstern function associating numerical utilities with outcomes for a player.

- **Profile of types** — A tuple collecting one type from each player, representing a possible joint private information scenario.

- **Relevant profiles of types (Y)** — The subset of type profiles that are possible or relevant in the model.

- **Static game of incomplete information** — A simultaneous-move game where some aspects (such as payoffs or beliefs) are uncertain to players.

- **Strategy set (Si)** — The set of strategies available to Player i in the underlying strategic form game.

- **Type (of a player)** — Represents a player’s private information, including her payoff function and beliefs about other players’ types.

- **Type-space approach** — A method for representing games of incomplete information by assigning a type space to each player, encoding payoffs and beliefs.

- **Type-space structure** — Composed of players’ sets of types, strategy sets, beliefs, and utility functions, formalizing incomplete information.

- **Uncertainty about own payoffs** — Situation where a player does not fully know her own payoffs but ranks possible outcomes consistently.

- **Utility function (state-dependent)** — The payoff function of a player may vary across states or types, reflecting uncertainty or incomplete information.

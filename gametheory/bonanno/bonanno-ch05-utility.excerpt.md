Expected Utility Theory provides a framework for ranking lotteries (probabilistic outcomes) based on a utility function that captures an individual's preferences and attitudes toward risk, distinguishing risk averse, risk neutral, and risk loving behaviors. The von Neumann-Morgenstern theorems establish that if preferences satisfy certain axioms, there exists a utility function unique up to positive affine transformations that represents these preferences through the expected utility of lotteries, enabling consistent decision-making under uncertainty.

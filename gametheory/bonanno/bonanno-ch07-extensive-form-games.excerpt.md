This chapter discusses extensive-form games with cardinal payoffs, focusing on behavioral strategies, which specify probability distributions at each information set and are shown to be equivalent to mixed strategies in games with perfect recall. It also revisits subgame-perfect equilibrium, illustrating that in finite extensive-form games with cardinal payoffs, subgame-perfect equilibria always exist, though some "unreasonable" Nash equilibria may require stronger refinements beyond subgame perfection.

The chapter discusses static games with incomplete information, focusing on modeling situations where players are uncertain about aspects of the game such as preferences or available actions, using interactive knowledge-belief structures and the Harsanyi transformation to convert these into extensive games with imperfect information. It explains one-sided, two-sided, and multi-sided incomplete information scenarios, illustrates the derivation of Bayesian Nash equilibria through the transformed games, and emphasizes the role of common priors in ensuring consistent probabilities across playersâ€™ beliefs.

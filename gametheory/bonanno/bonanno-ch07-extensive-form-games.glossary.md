- **Behavioral strategy** — A list of probability distributions, one for each information set of a player, assigning probabilities to the available choices at that information set in an extensive-form game.
- **Cardinal payoffs** — Numerical payoffs representing players’ preferences according to von Neumann-Morgenstern utility functions, allowing for comparisons of lotteries over outcomes.
- **Chance moves (Nature’s moves)** — Random events explicitly represented in an extensive-form game by nodes where Nature chooses among possible outcomes according to a fixed probability distribution.
- **Extensive-form game/frame** — A representation of a dynamic strategic game incorporating the order of moves, available actions at each decision point, information sets, and (possibly) chance moves, with payoffs assigned to terminal nodes.
- **Information set** — A collection of decision nodes between which a player cannot distinguish when making a choice, capturing imperfect information in extensive-form games.
- **Lottery** — A probability distribution over basic outcomes in a game, representing uncertain results resulting from mixed or behavioral strategies or chance moves.
- **Mixed strategy** — A probability distribution over a player’s pure strategies; in extensive-form games, a mixed strategy assigns probabilities to complete plans of actions.
- **Perfect recall** — A property of an extensive-form game where players remember all their previous choices and all information they knew earlier when making decisions at each information set.
- **Proper subgame** — A subgame generated by a subnode of the original game’s tree that contains the entire future game from that node, beginning with a single decision node and including all its descendants.
- **Strategic form (Normal form) of a game** — A matrix representation of a game listing players’ strategies and their associated payoffs given combinations of strategies.
- **Subgame-perfect equilibrium** — A refinement of Nash equilibrium in extensive-form games that requires players’ strategies to constitute a Nash equilibrium in every subgame of the original game.
- **Terminal node** — A final node in the extensive form where the game ends and payoffs are assigned to the players.
- **von Neumann-Morgenstern utility function** — A real-valued function assigned to outcomes that represents preferences over lotteries, satisfying the axioms of expected utility theory.
- **von Neumann-Morgenstern ranking** — A player’s complete and transitive preference ordering over lotteries that can be represented by a von Neumann-Morgenstern utility function.
- **Behavioral vs mixed strategy equivalence** — Theorem stating that in extensive-form games with perfect recall, for every mixed strategy there exists a behaviorally equivalent behavioral strategy yielding the same distribution over terminal nodes.
- **Imperfect information** — When a player cannot distinguish among multiple nodes in an information set, leading to uncertainty about the exact game state during play.
- **Expected utility** — The weighted average utility of all possible outcomes of a lottery, where weights are the probabilities assigned by the lottery.
- **IDSDS (Iterated Deletion of Strictly Dominated Strategies)** — A solution procedure eliminating strategies that are strictly dominated, often used to simplify games and find equilibrium.
- **Normal form reduction** — The process of converting an extensive-form game into its strategic-form representation.

- **AGM-consistency** — A property of an assessment where strategies and beliefs are rationalized by a plausibility order satisfying conditions linking positive probability actions and most plausible histories.

- **Assessment (σ, µ)** — A pair consisting of a strategy profile σ and a system of beliefs µ in an extensive-form game.

- **Bayesian consistency** — A quantitative restriction on assessments requiring beliefs to update according to Bayes' rule whenever possible, especially after surprise moves.

- **Behavior strategy** — A function assigning to each information set a probability distribution over available actions.

- **Choice measurability** — A property of a plausibility order meaning it admits an integer-valued representation that preserves plausibility differences when extended by the same action.

- **Extensive form** — A representation of a game as a tree of histories (action sequences) with players, information sets, and available actions defined.

- **Full-support common prior** — A probability distribution over decision histories assigning positive probability to all histories, consistent with the Bayesian updates on equivalence classes.

- **History-based definition** — A definition identifying nodes in the game tree with the sequence of actions leading from the root, called histories.

- **Information set** — An equivalence class of decision histories at which a player cannot distinguish the history within the class.

- **KW-consistency** — Kreps-Wilson consistency; a notion of consistency for belief revision based on limits of completely mixed strategy profiles (see Section 12.1.1).

- **Lexicographic probability system** — A system (not explicitly defined in this text) often used in refinements of equilibrium concepts (contextual background).

- **Ordinal integer-valued representation** — A function from histories to non-negative integers representing a plausibility order by preserving order (lower integers mean more plausible).

- **Plausibility order** — A total preorder on the set of histories where adding an action cannot increase plausibility and plausibility preserving actions exist uniformly across information sets.

- **Perfect Bayesian equilibrium (PBE)** — An assessment that is sequentially rational, AGM-consistent, and Bayesian consistent relative to a plausibility order.

- **Perfect recall** — A property ensuring players remember all their previous information sets and the actions they have taken.

- **Plays that are plausibility preserving** — Actions that appended to a decision history yield equally plausible histories.

- **Properties PL1, PL2, PL3** — Requirements for a plausibility order ensuring that adding actions does not increase plausibility, some actions preserve plausibility uniformly across information sets, and chance moves preserve plausibility, respectively.

- **Sequential equilibrium (SE)** — A refinement of perfect Bayesian equilibrium requiring consistency of beliefs derived as limits of fully mixed strategies.

- **Sequential rationality** — The requirement that strategies maximize expected utility at every information set given the system of beliefs.

- **Subgame-perfect equilibrium** — An equilibrium that induces a Nash equilibrium in every subgame; PBE refines this concept.

- **Total pre-order** — A binary relation on a set that is complete (any two elements are comparable) and transitive.

- **Uniform Bayesian consistency** — An enhanced Bayesian consistency condition requiring the existence of a full-support common prior consistent with the assessment and plausibility order, preserving probabilities after adding actions.

- **Weak independence (IND1)** — A condition on plausibility orders that preserves relative plausibility after appending the same action on histories in the same information set.

- **Weakly independent perfect Bayesian equilibrium** — A PBE where the plausibility order satisfies weak independence and uniform Bayesian consistency holds.

- **Strong independence (IND2)** — A property requiring that relative plausibility ordering of actions at one history extends to corresponding actions at any history in the same information set.

- **Strongly independent perfect Bayesian equilibrium** — A refinement of weakly independent PBE where the plausibility order satisfies both weak and strong independence and uniform Bayesian consistency.

- **Strategy profile (σ)** — A tuple of strategies, one for each player, specifying their plans at all information sets.

- **Terminal history** — A history corresponding to an endpoint in the extensive-form game tree with no actions available.

The chapter develops a precise epistemic framework for strategic-form games with cardinal payoffs, defining rationality as players choosing optimal pure strategies given their beliefs within interactive knowledge-belief structures, and shows that common knowledge of rationality corresponds exactly to the iterated deletion of strictly dominated strategies. It further discusses challenges in extending this framework to extensive-form games, where interpretation of strategies involves counterfactual plans, and presents proofs and exercises illustrating the connection between rationality, knowledge, and iterative dominance in game-theoretic models.

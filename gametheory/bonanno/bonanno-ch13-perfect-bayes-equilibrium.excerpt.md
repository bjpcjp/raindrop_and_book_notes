The text provides a detailed analysis of Perfect Bayesian Equilibrium (PBE) in extensive-form games, including definitions of belief revision, AGM-consistency, Bayesian consistency, and refinements incorporating independence conditions. It culminates in establishing that sequential equilibrium can be characterized as a PBE rationalized by a choice-measurable plausibility order and uniformly Bayesian consistent, with examples and exercises illustrating relationships among equilibrium concepts.

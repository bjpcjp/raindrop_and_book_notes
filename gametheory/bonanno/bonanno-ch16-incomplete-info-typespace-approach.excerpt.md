The chapter explains the equivalence between the interactive knowledge-belief structures and Harsanyi’s type-space approach for representing static games of incomplete information, illustrating how types encode players' payoffs and beliefs. It further generalizes the model to allow players’ payoffs to depend on others’ types and details methods for transforming between “state-space” and “type-space” representations.

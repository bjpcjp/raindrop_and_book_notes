This chapter explores the formal modeling of knowledge and common knowledge in multi-agent settings using information partitions and knowledge operators, illustrating how individuals' knowledge and higher-order knowledge can be represented and analyzed. It highlights that common knowledge, a critical concept in interactive reasoning, can be characterized via the common knowledge partition, allowing for practical computation of events that are commonly known among agents.

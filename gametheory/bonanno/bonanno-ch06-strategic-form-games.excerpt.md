This chapter introduces strategic-form games with cardinal payoffs, extending the classical framework to include probabilistic outcomes and von Neumann-Morgenstern utility functions, allowing players to evaluate lotteries over basic outcomes. It further develops the concept of mixed strategies, Nash equilibria in mixed strategies, and methods for computing such equilibria, emphasizing the role of strict dominance and rationalizability in simplifying games and characterizing players' rational behavior.

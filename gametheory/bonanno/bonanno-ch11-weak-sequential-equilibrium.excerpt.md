This chapter introduces the concept of weak sequential equilibrium in extensive-form games, defining it as an assessment consisting of a profile of behavioral strategies and a system of beliefs that satisfy sequential rationality and Bayesian updating at reached information sets. It further explores the relationship between weak sequential equilibrium, Nash equilibrium, and subgame-perfect equilibrium, demonstrating that weak sequential equilibrium is a strict refinement of Nash equilibrium but does not necessarily coincide with subgame-perfect equilibrium, and establishes that every finite extensive-form game with cardinal payoffs has at least one weak sequential equilibrium.

This chapter introduces the integration of probabilistic beliefs into knowledge structures, explaining how individuals assign likelihoods to uncertain states using probability distributions and update these beliefs rationally upon receiving new information through Bayesian conditioning. It further explores belief revision when encountering surprising information, the concept of like-mindedness via common priors, and the fundamental Agreement Theorem stating that like-minded individuals cannot agree to disagree if their differing beliefs become common knowledge.

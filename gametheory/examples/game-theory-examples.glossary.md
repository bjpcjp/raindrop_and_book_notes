- **action** — A decision or move chosen by a player at a given position in a game.  
- **additivity (of payoffs)** — Assumption that total payoff is the sum of individual utilities or satisfactions.  
- **bimatrix** — A table representing a two-player simultaneous game, with payoffs for each player in each cell.  
- **best response** — A move that yields the highest payoff given the other players’ moves.  
- **best response digraph** — A graph showing moves as vertices with arcs indicating best responses between moves.  
- **behavioral strategy** — A plan that assigns probabilities to moves in each position of a game tree.  
- **cardinal scale** — A scale measuring quantities where differences are meaningful and additive.  
- **coalition** — A group of players who may cooperate in a game.  
- **complete information** — When all players know the structure of the game, including payoffs and moves of all players.  
- **cooperative game** — A game where binding agreements and enforceable contracts among players are possible.  
- **dominated move** — A move that is always worse than some other move for a player, making it irrational to play.  
- **extensive form** — A representation of a sequential game as a game tree or game digraph showing moves and timing.  
- **finite game** — A game with a finite number of players, moves, and outcomes.  
- **game tree** — A graphical representation of all possible moves and outcomes in a sequential game.  
- **game theory** — Mathematical study of interactions where multiple players make decisions affecting outcomes.  
- **information set** — A collection of decision nodes among which a player cannot distinguish, representing imperfect information.  
- **maximin move** — A strategy that maximizes a player’s minimum guaranteed payoff in the worst-case scenario.  
- **mixed strategy** — A probability distribution over pure strategies, used to randomize moves.  
- **Nash equilibrium** — A set of strategies where no player can improve their payoff by unilaterally changing their own strategy.  
- **normal form** — A matrix or table representation of simultaneous games listing players’ strategies and payoffs.  
- **outcome** — The result generated by players’ combination of moves in a game, associated with payoffs.  
- **payoff** — The quantity (like money or utility) a player receives as a result of the outcome of a game.  
- **perfect information** — A property that players know all previous moves when making a decision in a sequential game.  
- **pure strategy** — A choice of a single move or action in every position in a game.  
- **sequential game** — A game where players make moves one after another, possibly more than once, with knowledge of previous moves.  
- **simultaneous game** — A game where all players make their moves at the same time without knowledge of others’ choices.  
- **strategy** — A complete plan specifying the moves a player will make in all possible positions.  
- **subgame perfect equilibrium** — A refinement of Nash equilibrium that requires strategies to be optimal in every subgame.  
- **symmetry (symmetric game)** — A game where all players have the same moves and payoffs are invariant under permutation of players.  
- **zero-sum game** — A game where one player’s gain is exactly another player’s loss, so the sum of payoffs is zero.

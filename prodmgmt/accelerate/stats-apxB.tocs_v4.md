- **Organizational Performance**
  - High performers are twice as likely to exceed both commercial and noncommercial organizational goals.
  - Stock ticker analysis shows high performers achieved 50% higher market capitalization growth over three years.
  - Performance outcomes include profitability, productivity, quality, and customer satisfaction.
  - See [Organizational Performance Metrics](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/organizational-performance.asp) for industry standards.

- **Software Delivery Performance**
  - Four key metrics classify software delivery performance: deploy frequency, lead time, mean time to restore, and change fail percentage.
  - Software delivery performance predicts organizational and noncommercial performance without trade-offs between tempo and stability.
  - High correlation exists with DevOps investment and negatively with deployment pain.
  - For deeper insight, consult [Continuous Delivery Practices](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/ContinuousDelivery.html).

- **Quality**
  - High performers spend more time on new work and less on unplanned work or rework compared to low performers.
  - Manual work is lower among high performers, particularly in configuration management and testing.
  - The J-curve phenomenon indicates medium performers sometimes do more manual or rework than low performers.
  - Refer to [Software Quality Metrics](https://www.sqa.org.uk/pages/metrics.html) for related metrics.

- **Burnout and Deployment Pain**
  - Deployment pain negatively correlates with software delivery performance and organizational culture.
  - Burnout is most strongly correlated with organizational culture, leadership, organizational investment, performance, and deployment pain.
  - See [Burnout in IT Professionals](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6534345/) for comprehensive research.

- **Technical Capabilities**
  - High performers use trunk-based development with integration times typically lasting hours, versus days or weeks for low performers.
  - Technical practices predict continuous delivery, culture, job satisfaction, and reduced burnout.
  - High performers spend 50% less time fixing security issues than low performers.
  - Explore [Technical Practices for DevOps](https://aws.amazon.com/devops/continuous-integration/) for more.

- **Architecture Capabilities**
  - No correlation exists between system type and software delivery performance.
  - Low performers are more likely to use custom software developed externally and work on mainframe systems.
  - Loosely coupled, well-encapsulated architecture strongly drives IT and continuous delivery performance.
  - Larger teams in high-performing groups increase deployment frequency significantly.
  - See [Microservices and Architecture Principles](https://martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html) for foundational concepts.

- **Lean Management Capabilities**
  - Lean management predicts organizational culture, job satisfaction, software delivery performance, and less burnout.
  - Change advisory boards negatively correlate with software delivery performance.
  - Lightweight or peer review change approval processes lead to higher software delivery performance.
  - Consult [Lean Management in IT](https://www.lean.org/WhoWeAre/NewsArticleDocuments/LeanITPrinciples-v4.pdf) for methods and impacts.

- **Lean Product Management Capabilities**
  - Experimental product development approaches correlate highly with continuous delivery technical practices.
  - Lean product development predicts organizational culture, software delivery performance, organizational performance, and reduced burnout.
  - Review [Lean Product Development](https://www.lean.org/whatslean/principles.cfm) for strategic approaches.

- **Organizational Culture Capabilities**
  - Culture strongly correlates with DevOps investment, leadership effectiveness, continuous delivery, cross-team collaboration, and performance.
  - Westrum organizational culture positively predicts software delivery, organizational performance, and job satisfaction.
  - Culture negatively correlates with deployment pain.
  - See [Westrum Culture Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westrum_organizational_culture_model) for detailed framework.

- **Identity, Employee Net Promoter Score (eNPS), and Job Satisfaction**
  - Identity predicts organizational performance and employee loyalty measured by eNPS.
  - Employees at high-performing organizations are 2.2 times more likely to recommend their employer as a great workplace.
  - Job satisfaction further predicts organizational performance.
  - More on eNPS at [Employee Net Promoter Score Explained](https://www.qualtrics.com/employee-experience/employee-net-promoter-score/).

- **Leadership**
  - High-performing teams report leaders with stronger vision, communication, intellectual stimulation, support, and recognition.
  - Transformational leadership strongly correlates with software delivery performance and eNPS.
  - Leadership influences lean product development and technical practices that enhance team performance.
  - Read [Transformational Leadership in Tech](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/332931564_Transformational_Leadership_and_Technological_Innovation) for context.

- **Diversity**
  - Women represent 5â€“6.5% of respondents from 2015 to 2017, with most teams having low female representation.
  - Majority of respondents identify as male; underrepresentation is self-reported by 12% of respondents.
  - Reflects ongoing challenges regarding gender diversity in software teams.
  - Refer to [Diversity in Tech](https://builtin.com/diversity-inclusion/diversity-in-tech) for trends and best practices.

- **Other**
  - Investment in DevOps strongly correlates with software delivery performance.
  - DevOps team membership grew from 16% in 2014 to 27% in 2017 among respondents.
  - DevOps is widespread across multiple operating systems including Linux and Windows variants.
  - Firmographics indicate high performance is achievable regardless of organization size, industry, or regulation.
  - See [State of DevOps Report](https://www.stateofdevops.com/) for broader insights.

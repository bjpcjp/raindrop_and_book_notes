- **Technical Practices**
  - **What Is Continuous Delivery?**
    - Continuous delivery enables safe, quick, and sustainable deployment of all types of changes, including features and bug fixes.
    - The five key principles are building quality in, working in small batches, automating repetitive tasks, pursuing continuous improvement, and shared responsibility.
    - Foundations include comprehensive configuration management, continuous integration, and continuous testing.

  - **The Impact of Continuous Delivery**
    - Continuous delivery capabilities strongly improve software delivery performance and reduce deployment pain and team burnout.
    - It fosters a generative, performance-oriented culture and increases employees' identification with their organization.
    - High-performing teams practicing CD deploy on demand and prioritize fast feedback on system quality.

  - **The Impact of Continuous Delivery on Quality**
    - Continuous delivery is correlated with lower change fail rates and improved quality metrics such as reduced rework and unplanned work.
    - High performers spend more time on new work and less on urgent, failure-driven tasks.
    - Unplanned work is a proxy for quality failures and continuous delivery helps reduce failure demand.

  - **Continuous Delivery Practices: What Works and What Doesnâ€™t**
    - Comprehensive use of version control, especially for configuration, correlates strongly with performance.
    - Reliable automated test suites primarily created and maintained by developers improve IT performance.
    - Trunk-based development with short-lived branches leads to better performance than long-lived branches.
    - Integration of information security throughout the delivery lifecycle without slowing progress enhances performance.

  - **Version Control**
    - Storing application code, system and application configurations, and build scripts in version control predicts IT performance.
    - Configuration version control is more strongly correlated with software delivery performance than code version control.
    - Comprehensive configuration management is essential for continuous delivery.
  - **Test Automation**
    - Automated tests must be reliable to instill confidence in software quality and release readiness.
    - Developer ownership of acceptance tests increases testability and maintenance.
    - Manual testing remains important for exploratory and usability testing alongside automated tests.
  - **Test Data Management**
    - Successful teams maintain adequate test data to run automated suites on demand without limitations.
    - Effective management of test data is critical for sustaining reliable test automation.
  - **Trunk-Based Development**
    - Teams with fewer than three active branches, merging within a day, achieve higher delivery performance.
    - Short-lived branches encourage refactoring and team communication compared to long-lived branches.
    - GitHub Flow suits part-time or open source contributors, but full-time teams benefit from trunk-based practices.

  - **Information Security**
    - High-performing teams integrate infosec feedback at every stage of the delivery process.
    - Security practices are incorporated without slowing development, improving delivery performance.
    - Security teams collaborate closely with developers to automate and embed security testing.
  - **Adopting Continuous Delivery**
    - Implementing continuous delivery demands rethinking team collaboration, tools, processes, and substantial automation investment.
    - Enterprise and application architecture is a critical obstacle to adoption.
    - Ongoing simplification of systems architecture ensures maintainable automation.
    - Further discussion on architecture constraints is provided in Chapter 5.

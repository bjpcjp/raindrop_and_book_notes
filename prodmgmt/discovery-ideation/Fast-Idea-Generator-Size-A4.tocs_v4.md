- **Introduction to the Fast Idea Generator**
  - This tool supports teams in generating ideas by examining problems or opportunities from multiple perspectives.
  - It challenges existing concepts by bending, breaking, and stretching normal rules to create surprising ideas quickly.
  - The Fast Idea Generator uses seven distinct approaches or challenges to stimulate innovative thinking.
  - For further reference, see [Nesta (2013) Fast Idea Generator](https://www.nesta.org.uk).

- **How to Use the Fast Idea Generator**
  - Step 1 involves starting with an existing concept, problem, or opportunity and applying the seven suggested challenges.
  - Step 2 requires reviewing generated ideas to select and develop the most viable innovations.
  - The tool is designed to encourage alternatives that challenge conventional practices.
  - It is fairly simple, self-administered, and requires relatively little time.
  - Additional practical tools for social innovation can be found at [Development Impact & You](https://developmentimpactandyou.org).

- **The Seven Challenges of the Fast Idea Generator**
  - **Inversion**
    - This challenge turns common practices upside down to generate new ideas.
    - Example: "Doctors treat patients" becomes "What if patients became doctors?"
  - **Integration**
    - This approach integrates the offer with other offers to create combined solutions.
    - Example: Schools provide day learning opportunities which could be integrated with other educational services.
  - **Extension**
    - This challenge extends the current offer beyond its normal boundaries.
    - Example: Expanding a "one size fits all" approach to accommodate diverse needs.
  - **Addition**
    - This involves adding a new element to the existing offer.
    - Example: Supermarkets delivering groceries and also providing hot meals to older people at home.
  - **Subtraction**
    - This challenge encourages removing or removing components to rethink the offer.
    - Example: Considering the impact of closing three prisons.
  - **Translation**
    - This approach translates practices from one field to another.
    - Example: Applying airport management methods to hospital operations.
  - **Grafting**
    - This challenge grafts an element of practice from one field onto another.
    - Example: Introducing coaching into secondary school education, where teaching and coaching are normally separate.
  - **Exaggeration**
    - This involves pushing something to its most extreme expression.
    - Example: Allowing students to access learning anytime and anywhere, beyond designated times and spaces.

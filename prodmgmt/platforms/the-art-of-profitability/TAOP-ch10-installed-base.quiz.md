1. **Q:** What are the two "buckets" discussed by Zhao and Steve, and how do their profit margins and demand volatility differ?  
   **A:** The two buckets are hardware/equipment (HW) and consumables (C). Hardware typically has very low profit margins (2-5%) and high customer price sensitivity with volatile demand driven by new demand factors. Consumables have much higher profit margins (10-15%), low price sensitivity because they are lower-ticket items, and lower demand volatility driven by continuing demand related to the size of the installed base.  
   **External example:** Printer manufacturers make low margins on printers (hardware) but high margins on ink cartridges (consumables) with stable demand from existing users. https://hbr.org/2009/07/the-power-of-the-installed-base

2. **Q:** How does the concept of "power" shift between the seller and buyer from the original hardware sale to the consumables sale, according to the text?  
   **A:** At the original hardware sale, the buyer holds the power due to many choices in the market. After the sale, power shifts to the seller because the buyer is locked into consumables specific to the seller’s hardware, limiting switching options and increasing seller control.  
   **External example:** Razor companies like Gillette sell blades (consumables) that only fit their razor handles (hardware), giving them control post-purchase. https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bait-and-hook.asp

3. **Q:** What risks does Steve identify that sellers face in managing installed base profit, and what are the consequences of those risks?  
   **A:** Sellers risk pricing consumables too high, which may upset buyers enough for them to switch brands or abandon the product, effectively "killing the goose" that lays the golden eggs. Sellers can also fail by not making it easy for customers to buy consumables—missing opportunities for reminders, early notice, or multiple-unit sales—thus passively losing potential growth.  
   **External example:** Microsoft’s initial pricing strategy with the Zune device and limited ecosystem access led to poor customer retention and ultimately failure. https://hbr.org/2014/08/product-pricing-mistakes

4. **Q:** How does the size of the installed base influence demand volatility for consumables, and what strategic implication does this have for sellers?  
   **A:** The bigger the installed base, the greater the difference between the volatile new demand (for hardware) and the more stable continuing demand (for consumables). This implies sellers can rely on a steady, predictable revenue stream from the consumables related to a large installed base if they nurture it properly.  
   **External example:** Mobile phone manufacturers with a large installed user base rely on continuing demand for accessories and apps to stabilize profits. https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/marketing-and-sales/our-insights/growth-in-a-connected-world

5. **Q:** What does Steve realize about their building supplies business in relation to installed base profit, and what opportunity does he suggest exists?  
   **A:** Steve realizes their building supplies business relies heavily on installed base profit from products like filters, screens, and linings, but they treat it as a passive business without efforts to retain or upgrade customers. He suggests there is an opportunity to actively market new, upgraded products (e.g., eco-friendly or nonallergenic filters) and organize product lines strategically to increase profitability.  
   **External example:** HVAC companies increasingly market upgraded air filters and smart thermostats to existing customers for recurring sales and upgrades. https://www.energystar.gov/products/heating_cooling/air_filters

6. **Q:** According to Zhao’s advice, what should guide decisions when developing strategies to capitalize on installed base profit?  
   **A:** Customers should guide the seller’s decisions, as they will determine what products they are willing to pay for and how much. Sellers must listen to customer needs and preferences before making strategic moves.  
   **External example:** Amazon’s customer-centric approach drives product development and pricing strategies based on customer data and feedback. https://hbr.org/2014/10/how-amazon-innovates-in-ways-that-google-and-apple-cant

7. **Q:** What reading assignment does Zhao give Steve, and what is the purpose of this assignment?  
   **A:** Zhao assigns Steve to reread the entire book "Made in America" and prepare a list of key points Steve missed in his first reading. The purpose is to deepen Steve’s understanding by identifying overlooked insights relevant to their discussion and work.  
   **External example:** Assigning iterative readings of important texts is a common educational practice to improve comprehension and identify deeper lessons. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4535177/

8. **Q:** How does Steve’s final excitement about organizing product lines relate to the concept of a “Pyramid” mentioned in the conversation?  
   **A:** Steve envisions structuring their disparate product lines logically and systematically like a “Pyramid,” implying a layered, organized approach designed for maximum profit that builds upon the installed base and consumables strategy, rather than leaving things haphazard.  
   **External example:** The “Pyramid principle” is used in business to organize ideas and products systematically for clarity and effective strategy. https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/strategy-and-corporate-finance/our-insights/the-pyramid-principle

9. **Q:** What is implied about the importance of proactive communication with customers in maximizing installed base profit?  
   **A:** Proactively communicating with customers through early notices, reminders, and facilitating multi-unit purchases can stimulate usage and growth, transforming installed base profit from a passive to an active revenue source, thus increasing profitability.  
   **External example:** Subscription services like Spotify use frequent engagement and reminders to maintain active users and encourage upgrades. https://hbr.org/2017/03/how-to-improve-customer-communication

10. **Q:** Summarize the relationship between customer price sensitivity for hardware versus consumables, and explain its significance in pricing strategy.  
    **A:** Customers are highly price sensitive when purchasing hardware because it is a large, one-time expense with many alternatives, whereas price sensitivity is much lower for consumables since each purchase is smaller and tied to prior hardware ownership. This difference allows sellers to price consumables more aggressively to boost margins without losing customers.  
    **External example:** Smartphone buyers are sensitive to the initial handset price but less sensitive to apps and accessories pricing, enabling companies to have diverse revenue streams. https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0167811618301077

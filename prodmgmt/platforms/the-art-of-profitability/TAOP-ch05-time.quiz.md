1. **Q:** How does the Switchboard pattern relate to the telecommunications equipment business as discussed by Steve and Zhao, and what are the potential benefits and risks of a company adopting this model while also being a manufacturer?
   **A:** The Switchboard pattern, originally connecting service suppliers with movie production companies, can be adapted in telecommunications by creating a company that offers a comprehensive mix of equipment, software, and services from many suppliers tailored to customer needs. The benefits include profit from equipment sales and inside knowledge of multiple products, enabling customized solutions and ongoing service contracts. If the company is also a manufacturer, it gains better margins on directly supplied equipment. However, the risk is that the company might prioritize its own products over the best customer solutions, requiring discipline to resist this temptation.

2. **Q:** Describe the approach Steve used to solve the Mount Fuji volume and time problem and explain the key mathematical and methodological concepts that Zhao emphasized as important.
   **A:** Steve approximated Mount Fuji’s volume by modeling it as a cone, using basic geometric volume formulas combined with reliable average dump truck volume data, and estimated the time to move the mountain by successive truckloads. Zhao emphasized that the method—using rough approximations, accessible information, and common sense—is more important than exact correctness. The key is asking critical questions and estimating orders of magnitude to solve unusual numerical problems.
   **External example:** Fermi problems use similar estimation methods to solve seemingly complex questions with rough data, such as estimating the number of piano tuners in Chicago. https://mathworld.wolfram.com/FermiProblem.html

3. **Q:** What critical business lesson does Zhao convey by linking the Mount Fuji problem-solving method to assessing business plans and decisions?
   **A:** Zhao stresses that many flawed business plans can be exposed by just a few simple calculations that question assumptions critically. The lesson is that business professionals rarely ask the right numerical questions about plans, products, or investments, and mastering a few key calculations can uncover fundamental weaknesses before committing resources.

4. **Q:** How did Terry Allen apply the Time Profit model at Waterstone Brothers, and what were the financial impacts of her “instant diffusion” system?
   **A:** Terry Allen recognized that Waterstone had a short six to nine-month innovation window, unlike Intel’s multi-year lead. She devised a system to rapidly educate all employees and notify clients just before new product launches, enabling quick market penetration. This “instant diffusion” caused revenue to jump from $30 million to $100 million and profit from $15 million to $70 million per new instrument.

5. **Q:** What is the “drudgery” phase in the innovation process according to Paul Cook’s excerpt, and why is mastering this phase crucial for business success?
   **A:** The drudgery phase is the challenging and tedious time after the initial excitement of an idea fades, during which the idea must be translated into practical products through detailed work with technical teams, cost control, and quality assurance. Mastering it requires sustained pressure and leadership attention; success here distinguishes winners from losers by turning ideas into viable market offerings.
   **External example:** Toyota’s success is often attributed to rigorous attention to detail and process improvements during production, transforming innovative designs into reliable products. https://www.toyota-global.com/company/vision_philosophy/toyota_production_system/

6. **Q:** What paradox in the semiconductor industry did Zhao point out regarding innovation in products versus innovation in business models?
   **A:** Zhao noted that while semiconductor companies frequently copy each other’s microchip designs, none have successfully adopted each other’s business models, such as Intel’s Time Profit approach, resulting in a lack of business model innovation even in an industry with heavy product innovation.
   **External example:** Although AMD and Intel compete on product technology, Intel’s unique business model, including manufacturing and licensing practices, sets it apart. https://www.researchgate.net/publication/324013049_Intel_vs_AMD_Product_Design_Strategies

7. **Q:** What key skill related to numeracy and problem-solving does Zhao encourage Steve to develop, and how does this skill benefit business decision-making?
   **A:** Zhao encourages developing the ability to use numbers to ask and answer critical, practical questions by approximating, estimating, and focusing on the most impactful calculations, rather than striving for perfect correctness. This helps identify the feasibility and risks of business initiatives quickly and effectively.
   **External example:** The Lean Startup method emphasizes rapid, data-driven hypothesis testing and learning through metrics to validate business ideas. https://hbr.org/2013/05/why-the-lean-start-up-changes-everything

8. **Q:** According to the conversation, why does Terry Allen’s persistence despite boredom and setbacks play a critical role in innovation-driven business success?
   **A:** Terry’s persistence was essential to overcoming the initial chaos and mistakes when implementing the instant diffusion system, addressing tedious but vital details to make the system efficient and profitable. Such stubbornness and focus on process are necessary to braid creativity with reliable execution.

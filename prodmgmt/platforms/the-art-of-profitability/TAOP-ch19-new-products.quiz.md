1. **Q:** What is the "Profit Parabola" and how does it relate to new product profit over a product’s lifecycle?
   **A:** The Profit Parabola describes the total profit earned in a market as a curve that rises (gold rush period), peaks (Pike’s Peak), and then falls to zero (no profit zone). It reflects that profit surges initially due to high margins and volume but declines as the market matures and competition increases, making it critical to manage investments strategically throughout the cycle.
   **External example:** The automotive industry illustrates this with electric vehicles where initial high profits from early adopters gradually decline as market saturation occurs. https://hbr.org/2019/05/the-electric-vehicle-economics

2. **Q:** What strategic rules did George Hawkins recommend for managing investments across the Profit Parabola?
   **A:** George advised overinvesting by a factor of three during the early "gold rush" stage to establish mindshare and build capacity aggressively, then reversing the investment ratio by underinvesting by a factor of three during and after Pike’s Peak to maximize cash flow, reduce risk, and prepare for the next cycle.
   **External example:** Apple’s investment in iPhones expanded rapidly at launch and was scaled back strategically as the product matured, focusing more on services later. https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2020/05/20/how-apple-is-changing-its-investment-strategies/

3. **Q:** How does the psychological aspect of New Product Profit affect companies during the early "gold rush" phase?
   **A:** During the gold rush, companies get swept up in rapid volume growth and fat margins, which often leads to a lack of clear strategic thinking about future declines, making it hard to prepare for Pike’s Peak and the subsequent no profit zone.
   **External example:** The surge and subsequent crash of Segway exemplify hype-driven "gold rush" behavior without long-term strategic planning. https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/02/business/02segway.html

4. **Q:** Contrast New Product Profit with Time Profit and Specialty Product Profit in terms of product cycle length, core skill, and metaphor.
   **A:** New Product Profit has a 60-month cycle, requires skill in shifting resources, and is metaphorically like surfing. Time Profit spans 24 months, needs speed (like race-car driving), while Specialty Product Profit has a 120-month cycle, involves selecting niches, and is likened to seismography.
   **External example:** The smartphone market (New Product Profit) vs. fashion trends (Time Profit) vs. pharmaceuticals (Specialty Product Profit). https://hbr.org/2014/03/strategy-in-the-age-of-smartphones

5. **Q:** What are the indicators that suggest a product is approaching the peak of the Profit Parabola according to George’s framework?
   **A:** Key indicators include year-to-year and quarter-to-quarter growth rate changes, price fluctuations, and customer enthusiasm or boredom indices, which can signal when to reverse investment and prepare for the profit decline phase.
   **External example:** Netflix tracked subscriber growth and engagement metrics to time investments in new content and technology ahead of market saturation. https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/how-netflix-uses-metrics-to-drive-growth

6. **Q:** Why is admitting the reality of the Profit Parabola considered the hardest step in George’s approach?
   **A:** Because accepting that total profit inevitably peaks and declines is emotionally difficult and counterintuitive, much like accepting unavoidable personal aging; denying it leads to poor strategic decisions and losses.
   **External example:** Kodak’s failure to accept the decline of film photography illustrates this denial’s costly impact. https://hbr.org/2012/12/kodaks-misguided-innovation-strategy

7. **Q:** How did Steve use the lesson from the aircraft parts presentation episode to improve his approach, according to the document?
   **A:** Steve reexamined the challenging questions after reflecting, wrote out clear answers, and planned to send a follow-up memo demonstrating additional research, thus turning a poor initial presentation into a strategic recovery.
   **External example:** Steve Jobs revising and relaunching products or presentations based on feedback is well documented. https://www.inc.com/molly-reynolds/how-steve-jobs-used-failure-to-succeed.html

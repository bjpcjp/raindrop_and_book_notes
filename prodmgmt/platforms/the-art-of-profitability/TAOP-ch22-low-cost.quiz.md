1. **Q:** What is the main danger of focusing solely on experience curve cost management in an organization, according to Steve’s analysis?  
   **A:** The main danger is that intense focus on reducing costs through the experience curve acts like operating a microscope at maximum power, which completely eliminates peripheral vision. This leads the organization to miss external changes or innovations that can make it irrelevant or obsolete.  
   **External example:** Kodak focused heavily on film technology while missing the digital photography revolution, leading to their decline. https://hbr.org/2004/07/what-kodak-missed

2. **Q:** How do Steve and Zhao describe the trade-off between focus and peripheral vision in managing a business?  
   **A:** They describe focus plus peripheral vision as totaling 100 percent. Increasing one reduces the other. Maximum focus (microscope) reduces peripheral vision (radar screen), and vice versa. Balancing both is critical for recognizing both current details and strategic external changes.  
   **External example:** Intel shifted focus from memory chips to microprocessors by balancing deep focus with peripheral vision to notice market shifts. https://www.investopedia.com/articles/markets/112215/how-intel-became-chip-giant.asp

3. **Q:** What are the two types of threats posed by lost peripheral vision the document identifies, and what examples are given?  
   **A:** The first, more traumatic threat is being made irrelevant by new materials or technologies (e.g., aluminum replacing steel cans, plastic replacing aluminum). The second, slower demise is when a new business model delivers the same value at significantly lower cost, exemplified by companies like Nucor, Southwest Air, and Dell.  
   **External example:** Netflix disrupted Blockbuster by delivering value (entertainment) at a lower cost through a new model (streaming). https://hbr.org/2016/11/how-netflix-changed-entertainment-industry

4. **Q:** What is Steve’s recommendation to counteract the dangers of excessive focus on cost reduction via the experience curve?  
   **A:** Steve recommends having two organizations working simultaneously — one focused on maximizing current business efficiency ("experience curve demons") and another exploring new, disruptive business designs from a "blank sheet of paper" perspective. This balances current profitability with future adaptability.  
   **External example:** Alphabet (Google) maintains separate units for core search advertising and moonshot projects like Waymo and Verily. https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2018/02/09/how-alphabet-balances-its-business-model-between-google-and-its-other-bets/

5. **Q:** According to the conversation, how does “value migration” affect the lifespan of business designs and organizational change?  
   **A:** The lifespan of a business design has shortened dramatically from decades to about five or six years, creating friction since organizations often take two to three years or more to adapt. This mismatch means businesses must anticipate changes early and create a runway to implement new designs before existing ones become obsolete.  
   **External example:** The smartphone industry sees rapid value migration with product cycles under two years and companies like Nokia failing to anticipate the shift. https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-28474932

6. **Q:** What skill do Steve and Zhao identify as critical to successfully managing and anticipating changes in business design, and how can it be learned?  
   **A:** The critical skill is anticipation—being able to foresee changes and start preparing early. It can be learned through studying repeating patterns of change, practicing pattern recognition, and developing instincts, as exemplified by elite athletes like Bill Russell, Lawrence Taylor, Wayne Gretzky, and Joe DiMaggio.  
   **External example:** Chess grandmasters develop anticipation skills by learning patterns and practicing decision-making under uncertainty. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3037844/

7. **Q:** How do Zhao and Steve relate the concepts of focus, anticipation, and changing business designs to organizational success over time?  
   **A:** They argue that success requires balancing intense focus on current efficiency with wide peripheral vision to anticipate changes. Organizations must continuously reinvent their business design every five years or so, anticipating shifts and preparing ahead to avoid being overtaken by innovation or value migration.  
   **External example:** Amazon’s continuous innovation strategy involves balancing operational efficiency with entering new markets early. https://hbr.org/2015/05/amazons-strategy-for-success

8. **Q:** What resources does Zhao recommend to Steve for learning how to better anticipate change, and why are these resources significant?  
   **A:** Zhao recommends “Russell Rules” by Bill Russell, highlighting the chapter on rebounding for its lessons on anticipation, and “Sources of Power” by Gary Klein, particularly pages on pattern recognition. These resources provide deep insights into how top performers develop the skill of anticipation in complex situations.  
   **External example:** Gary Klein's work on naturalistic decision making is foundational in understanding expert anticipation and decision-making. https://books.google.com/books/about/Sources_of_Power.html?id=M0f_WRhsJfIC

1. **Q:** What is the fundamental concept of Multi-Component Profit as explained in the text, and how does it differ from Pyramid Profit?
   **A:** Multi-Component Profit involves a single product sold through multiple business components, each with different cost and profit profiles, reflecting varying customer purchase occasions and price sensitivities. Pyramid Profit, in contrast, is based on a range of distinct products targeted at different customer segments with varying willingness to pay.  
   **External example:** Amazon uses Multi-Component Profit by selling the same products through retail, subscription services (Prime), and third-party marketplace fees. https://hbr.org/2017/05/the-elements-of-value

2. **Q:** How did Burton apply the Multi-Component Profit model to independent bookstores, and what were the financial outcomes?
   **A:** Burton segmented the bookstore business into components like corporate accounts, book groups, and individual high-purchase customers, each generating higher profits through targeted outbound selling. This drove sales from $10 million to $12 million, raised profit from $0.1 million to $1 million, increased return on sales from 1% to 8%, and return on assets from 3% to 33%, without significant increases in assets or labor costs.  
   **External example:** Specialty coffee shops increase profitability by adding multiple revenue streams such as retail beans, subscriptions, and cafe sales, akin to Multi-Component Profit. https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/what-is-a-business-model/

3. **Q:** What role did Carole Woodward play in the success of Burton’s Multi-Component Profit strategy with bookstores?
   **A:** Carole Woodward was the energetic bookstore owner who persuaded Burton to develop the business strategy, organized the Mid-Atlantic Booksellers Association to implement it, maintained regular contact to track progress, and eventually secured a collective financial reward for Burton, enabling his retirement.

4. **Q:** According to Zhao, why is it problematic if a company, such as Delmore’s telecom division, fails to develop profitable Customer Solutions?
   **A:** Failure to expand offerings to profitable Customer Solutions results in operating in a "no-profit zone," which threatens long-term sustainability. Without these profitable expansions, the business structure becomes unstable and can collapse rapidly once foundation cracks appear.  
   **External example:** Kodak’s collapse was partly due to failure to innovate profitable solutions in digital photography, leading to a no-profit zone. https://hbr.org/2012/07/how-kodak-missed-the-digital-photography-revolution

5. **Q:** Explain the significance of understanding customer price sensitivity in the Multi-Component Profit model using the Coca-Cola example.
   **A:** Customer price sensitivity varies across purchase occasions (vending machine, restaurant, grocery), resulting in the same product generating different profit margins depending on the sales channel. Recognizing this enables targeted pricing and profit maximization across components of the same product.  
   **External example:** Airlines use differential pricing for the same seat across channels and purchase times to optimize profits, reflecting varying customer price sensitivity. https://www.iata.org/en/publications/economics/airline-business-strategy/

6. **Q:** What strategic insight did Burton provide to independent booksellers to increase profitability, and why had they not realized it before?
   **A:** Burton showed booksellers they could actively target and grow separate high-profit customer segments—corporate accounts, book groups, and individual buyers—transforming these into distinct components generating outsized profits. Previously, booksellers saw these customers as monolithic and had not deliberately separated or pursued these segments.  
   **External example:** Nike segmented its customer base into athletes, casual wearers, and collectors, tailoring marketing to each and greatly increasing profitability. https://hbr.org/2004/09/the-new-rules-of-marketing

7. **Q:** What are the key assumptions about business components that underpin the Multi-Component Profit model?
   **A:** The model assumes that a single business or product has multiple components differentiated by customer type, purchase occasion, or usage context, each with distinct cost structures and profitability, and that customers exhibit differing price sensitivities across these components.  
   **External example:** Apple’s product lines (iPhone, services, accessories) represent different components with unique profit margins that collectively drive company profitability. https://www.investopedia.com/articles/markets/080916/apple-business-segmentation.asp

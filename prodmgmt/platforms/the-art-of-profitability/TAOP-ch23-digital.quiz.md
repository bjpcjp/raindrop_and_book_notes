1. **Q:** What is the core difference between conventional and digital business models as discussed by Steve and Zhao, and how does this difference impact profitability?
   **A:** The core difference is that digital business models enable a tenfold improvement in productivity by allowing real-time information flow, customer self-service tasks, and shifting business processes from push (guess) to pull (know), including letting customers design products via Choiceboards. This results in profit margins about ten points higher than conventional competitors, with 30 to 70 percent of the difference attributed to digital effects.

2. **Q:** How does the passage explain the paradox involved in business, and what specific example does Steve use to illustrate this paradox?
   **A:** The passage explains business is full of paradoxes where obvious actions are often not taken. Steve illustrates this with the example that "the more obvious something is, the less often it’s done," highlighting that despite clear patterns like recession memory decay, businesses routinely fail to act on them.
   **External example:** The paradox of airport security often being enhanced after major security failures reflects the "obvious but neglected" phenomenon. https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0312407X.2013.807235

3. **Q:** What is the significance of "first cousins" in profit models according to Zhao, and why did he instruct Steve not to group them together in the lessons?
   **A:** "First cousins" are profit models that are similar but have important differences; Zhao asked Steve not to group them to avoid focusing on similarities that could obscure understanding of their unique distinctions. This approach fosters deeper analysis rather than superficial comparison.
   **External example:** In psychology, related but distinct cognitive biases such as confirmation bias and anchoring bias are studied separately to understand subtle differences. https://www.apa.org/science/about/psa/2010/04/cognitive-biases

4. **Q:** According to the dialogue, why can becoming digital not redeem a fundamentally flawed business design, despite its significant profit impact?
   **A:** Because digital advantages amplify an already sound business design but do not fix underlying flaws. Without a fundamentally sound business model, the digital effect is essentially worthless, as profitability also depends on solid business fundamentals.
   **External example:** Kodak’s failure to transition digitally despite digital innovation highlights that technology alone cannot save a flawed business strategy. https://hbr.org/2012/11/kodaks-failure-to-recognize

5. **Q:** How does Steve describe the role of customers in digital business models, and what are the profitability implications?
   **A:** Steve explains that in digital models, customers shift from passive buyers to active participants—designing products, accessing information, scheduling services, and self-solving issues. This reduces costs (e.g., Cisco’s 85% customer answered questions) and increases satisfaction, driving profitability by reducing service expenses and improving customer loyalty.

6. **Q:** What is the relationship between profitability and information at the macro level as discussed, and why is this significant?
   **A:** Profitability is often dependent on the quality of information; bad information causes inefficiency and loss. Digital business models improve information flow speed and accuracy, allowing quicker problem detection and resource redeployment, thereby enhancing profit margins.
   **External example:** Walmart’s use of real-time sales data reduces inventory costs and increases profitability. https://hbr.org/2009/01/walmart-the-real-time-retail-giant

7. **Q:** What reasoning does Steve provide for assigning two books on a given topic, and how does this method aid his learning?
   **A:** Assigning two books encourages comparing perspectives, contrasting ideas, and moving beyond merely having read a book to understanding which ideas apply best in practice. It counters the "I read the book" syndrome by fostering critical thinking and application.
   **External example:** Academic courses often assign multiple readings to develop critical comparison and synthesis skills. https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10508406.2010.509306

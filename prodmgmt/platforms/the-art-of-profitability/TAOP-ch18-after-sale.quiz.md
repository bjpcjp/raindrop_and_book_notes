1. **Q:** What are the key factors that determine buyer price sensitivity, and how do these factors collectively influence the profit dynamics in the initial sale versus the after-sale market?
   **A:** Buyer price sensitivity is highest when the ticket price is high, price variability is high, and there are many options available, leading to intense price competition and reduced profits in the initial sale of big-ticket items. Conversely, in the after-sale market, items have lower ticket prices (often one-tenth or one-hundredth), lower price sensitivity, and fewer options, creating higher profit margins and recurring revenue opportunities.
   **External example:** Apple’s initial sale of iPhones faces high competition and price sensitivity, but its after-sale market—services like AppleCare and accessory sales—captures higher margins with less price sensitivity. https://hbr.org/2014/03/the-power-of-after-sale-services

2. **Q:** How does the After-Sale Profit model differ from the Installed Base model in terms of who profits and what types of products or services are sold?
   **A:** The Installed Base model profits the original product makers through sales to their existing customers, typically involving products they produce themselves. In contrast, the After-Sale Profit model profits different players—such as insurance companies, brokers, software vendors, or retailers—who sell add-ons, service plans, or accessories related to the original hardware product, capturing recurring revenue streams that the original sellers often forgo.
   **External example:** Car manufacturers build the cars, but insurance companies capture profits from auto insurance policies sold to the same customers afterward. https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/installed-base.asp

3. **Q:** Why do big-ticket hardware sellers often fail to capitalize on the after-sale profit opportunities, despite the clear advantages these opportunities present?
   **A:** They fail because of incomplete business scope; the after-sale business requires different skills, systems, incentives, and organizational structures, resulting in separate business models with less glamor and visibility. Psychological factors—such as focus on market share and initial sales prestige—and organizational incentive misalignment prevent them from integrating after-sale offerings effectively.
   **External example:** Printer manufacturers often do not profit equally from printer ink sales, which third parties dominate due to separate business models and incentives. https://www.inc.com/guides/2010/06/defining-your-business-scope.html

4. **Q:** What organizational changes are necessary for hardware sellers to successfully implement an After-Sale Profit model, according to the dialogue?
   **A:** They must create separate, dedicated organizations and systems focused on after-sale products and services, connect these meaningfully to the base organization, and incentivize hundreds of people on profitability rather than just sales volume. Customizing after-sale offerings to the original product to provide compelling customer reasons to buy from them is also essential.
   **External example:** IBM successfully transformed parts of its hardware business by creating service and software divisions with separate incentives, increasing after-sale profitability. https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/ibms-business-transformation/

5. **Q:** What psychological and perceptual challenges are involved for managers and investors when dealing with after-sale profit opportunities, and how do these impact decision-making?
   **A:** Managers and investors often focus on market share and high-visibility sales ("sex and prestige"), undervaluing the less glamorous but highly profitable after-sale business. Additionally, they tend to ask incorrect questions based on what they want to know rather than what they fear to find out, leading to missed signals about obsolete business designs or flawed investments. Perception bias further impairs seeing realities objectively.
   **External example:** Venture capital firms often overlook profitable maintenance and recurring services businesses due to focus on rapid growth and market share. https://hbr.org/2016/03/why-investors-are-skeptical-of-software-as-a-service-stocks

6. **Q:** How can investors leverage the After-Sale Profit model to achieve profitable investments, and what caution does Zhao offer to Steve regarding this strategy?
   **A:** Investors can identify companies with strong after-sale profit businesses, which often have more stable, recurring revenue and higher margins than initial sales businesses. Zhao cautions that while the idea is promising, brilliant application is crucial, requiring deep customer insight and careful analysis to avoid losing money in the gap between theory and practice.

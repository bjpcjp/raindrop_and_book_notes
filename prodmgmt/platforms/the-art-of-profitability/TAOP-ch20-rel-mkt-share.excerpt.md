Relative Market Share (RMS) profit, discovered in the 1960s and popularized in the 1980s, explains profitability through the advantages of scale in manufacturing, purchasing, marketing, and talent attraction, making market leaders more profitable and less risky. Although RMS remains important, modern profitability depends on multiple factors including time, location, and value chain position, requiring managers to adopt diverse models and a mindset of continuous inquiry.

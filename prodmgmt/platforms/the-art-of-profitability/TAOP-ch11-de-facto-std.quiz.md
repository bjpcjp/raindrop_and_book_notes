1. **Q:** What key lesson does Zhao emphasize to Steve about dealing with setbacks such as missing the opportunity to launch the telecom Switchboard first?
   **A:** Zhao advises Steve not to take setbacks personally to avoid wasting energy on irritation and anger, which can lead to further mistakes; instead, he recommends looking ahead and learning from missed opportunities.
   **External example:** Steve Jobs initially being ousted from Apple taught him resilience and future success, as noted in his biography by Walter Isaacson (https://www.biography.com/business-figure/steve-jobs).

2. **Q:** How does Zhao characterize the minicomputer industry's success and demise in relation to the Installed Base Profit model?
   **A:** The minicomputer industry exemplified the Installed Base Profit model by locking customers into proprietary systems with high prices, but its downfall was due to the high indirect costs like time, energy, and irritation caused by incompatibility, not just direct financial costs.
   **External example:** The IBM PC's open architecture led to wider compatibility and reduced customer irritation versus proprietary minicomputers (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/739925).

3. **Q:** What is the primary business advantage of being the owner of a de facto standard, according to Zhao and Steve's discussion?
   **A:** The primary advantage is plannability: owners can shape the industry’s future because their business plan drives it, allowing them to avoid costly surprises that force reactive adjustments.
   **External example:** Microsoft's dominance with Windows allowed strategic planning and industry influence (https://hbr.org/2000/09/how-microsoft-ways-dominate-markets).

4. **Q:** Besides plannability, what is the other major source of profitability for de facto standard owners as explained in the dialogue?
   **A:** De facto standard owners benefit from reduced marketing and sales expenses because customers effectively do their marketing by demanding the standard, which lowers acquisition costs by 20-30% on relevant sales.
   **External example:** Apple's established ecosystem encourages users to recommend products, lowering marketing costs (https://www.forbes.com/sites/garydrenik/2021/12/05/apple-a-marketing-case-study/).

5. **Q:** Why does Zhao say the longevity of standards-based businesses like IBM mainframes is unlikely to be repeated today?
   **A:** Because contemporary markets require companies to continuously move from one emerging opportunity ("lily pad") to the next, unlike the relatively stable, decades-long dominance seen with IBM mainframes.
   **External example:** The rapid evolution of smartphone platforms illustrates this shift, with quick turnover of dominant standards (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877050920300126).

6. **Q:** What specific reading assignments does Zhao give Steve to prepare him for the next lesson, and what is the intended purpose?
   **A:** Zhao assigns two advertising books by David Ogilvy to provide enjoyment and perspective on advertising’s purpose and effect, and also a chapter from "ABC of Reading" by Ezra Pound, aiming to expose Steve to distinct characters and styles to enrich his thinking without focusing on profit models.
   **External example:** David Ogilvy’s influence on advertising strategy shows the importance of perspective in marketing (https://www.ogilvy.com/ogilvy-on-advertising/).

7. **Q:** What challenge does Zhao present to Steve in his voicemail and why is it significant in understanding brand power?
   **A:** Zhao asks Steve to identify three instances where identical products or services command different prices solely due to brand power, which is significant because it highlights how branding can create value and influence pricing independent of product differences.
   **External example:** The premium pricing of Coca-Cola over generic colas due to brand value (https://hbr.org/2014/07/why-coca-cola-is-the-most-valuable-brand).

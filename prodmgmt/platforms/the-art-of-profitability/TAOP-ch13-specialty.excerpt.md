The profitability in specialty product businesses like dyestuffs has shifted from high-margin, patented products to low-margin commodity models, requiring a fundamental cultural and strategic transformation in managing R&D portfolios. Effective portfolio management—such as discontinuing low-value projects, reallocating resources to high-value ones, and engaging in strategic licensing and joint development—can restore specialty product ratios and improve returns, distinguishing specialty product profit models from blockbuster profit models that demand large-scale marketing or development investments.

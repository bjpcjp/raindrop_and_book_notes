1. **Q:** What is meant by "control points" in the business value chain landscape according to Zhao, and how do they relate to profitability and power?
   **A:** Control points are specific positions in the value chain that are disproportionately valuable and critical for securing profit, power, and control. These points are analogous to strategic geographic locations like mountain passes and river fords, where controlling them yields outsized advantage, making their control crucial in business competition.
   **External example:** Apple’s control over iOS and its app store creates a control point that captures significant value beyond hardware sales.

2. **Q:** According to the discussion, what are the main circumstances that influence whether a value chain position becomes a control point with extraordinary profitability?
   **A:** Control points arise based on conditions like the relative value added trajectory (e.g., Microsoft and Intel vs. PC makers), creation of scarcity, identifying and capturing bottlenecks, and better connection to the customer compared to other players in the value chain.
   **External example:** Amazon’s dominance in e-commerce is due to its scalable logistics and customer connection, creating a control point over traditional retailers.

3. **Q:** How do shifts or disruptions change the location of control points in a value chain, and what are some examples of industries where radical shifts have occurred?
   **A:** Shifts such as technological changes, market disruptions, or evolving customer demands can move control points by changing what part of the value chain captures value and power. Examples include computing (shift from integrated systems to specialist suppliers like Intel and Microsoft), athletic shoes (power moving to marketers and designers like Nike), and Hollywood (power redistribution via agents like Ovitz).
   **External example:** The smartphone industry's shift to app ecosystems controlled by Google and Apple changed the control points from hardware makers.

4. **Q:** What role does predictability play in sustaining profit at a control point within the value chain?
   **A:** Predictability allows the company controlling the critical position to define the future pace and business plan of the industry, forcing others to react and remain a step behind, thus maintaining its superior profitability and power.
   **External example:** Intel’s predictable advancements and roadmaps in semiconductor manufacturing allow it to set the industry standard and capture sustained profits.

5. **Q:** How does Zhao’s analogy between geographic strategic points and business value chain control points deepen the understanding of why some business positions are "ten times more valuable" than others?
   **A:** Just as geographic choke points like mountain passes control movement and military advantage, certain business value chain positions control the flow of value, influence, and profitability in the market. These spots concentrate power due to their strategic importance, scarcity, or unique ability to connect and influence the customer or ecosystem.
   **External example:** The Panama Canal operates as a geographic choke point essential to global shipping, analogous to Amazon’s control over critical digital retail infrastructure.

6. **Q:** Can control points in the value chain be created intentionally, or must they pre-exist? Provide reasoning based on the text and an example.
   **A:** Control points can be created intentionally by redesigning business models to redistribute power and profit within the value chain, as exemplified by Ovitz’s transformation of Hollywood’s business design, demonstrating that control points are not always pre-existing but can be crafted strategically.
   **External example:** Netflix deliberately created a new control point by shifting from DVD rentals to streaming and content production, changing media distribution dynamics.

7. **Q:** Why might a supplier prefer being a control point rather than simply a supplier to a dominant company in the value chain, and what example does the text use to illustrate this?
   **A:** Being a control point offers predictability, power, and a larger share of profits since your business plan drives the industry pace, whereas being a supplier places the firm in a reactive, dependent position with limited profitability. The text illustrates this with Wal-Mart versus its suppliers, where Wal-Mart holds the power.
   **External example:** Walmart’s control over retail supply chains forces suppliers to comply with pricing and logistics demands, limiting supplier margins.

8. **Q:** What reading assignment does Zhao give Steve, and what is the intended learning goal from this exercise?
   **A:** Zhao assigns the reading of “The Computerless Computer Company,” a Harvard Business Review article that explores shifts in rules and control points in business. Steve is instructed to read it three times separately and summarize the key points each time to deepen understanding of how control points arise and shift.
   **External example:** The concept of strategic control points is elaborated in the HBR article “The Core Competence of the Corporation,” which discusses how firms create value through focused control points.

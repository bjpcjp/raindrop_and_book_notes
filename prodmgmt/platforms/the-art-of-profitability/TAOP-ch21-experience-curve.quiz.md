1. **Q:** What is the experience curve effect as demonstrated in the denim plant example, and how did it impact the plant’s profit margins over time?  
   **A:** The experience curve effect shows that with every doubling of cumulative manufacturing experience, direct labor costs dropped by 25%, raw materials and energy costs dropped by 15%, but overhead costs rose by 40%, which was initially problematic. Correcting overhead costs to expected levels nearly doubled the plant’s profit from $10 million to $24 million, and sustained application led to steady margin improvements and growth even amid flat revenues and eroding prices.  
   **External example:** Toyota used experience curve effects to reduce production costs and improve quality over time, enabling consistent profit margins. https://hbr.org/1990/07/the-experience-curve-revisited

2. **Q:** How does the experience curve differ fundamentally from relative market share in terms of competitive advantage?  
   **A:** The experience curve advantage is based on the rate of learning that reduces costs with cumulative production experience, crucial when production cost is a large percentage of revenues. Relative market share advantage depends on scale effects like purchasing power, overhead spreading, and pricing leverage, which matter more when costs are a smaller portion of revenue. Thus, growth strategies in cost-driven versus scale-driven businesses require different management focuses.  
   **External example:** P&G uses relative market share to gain scale advantages in marketing and distribution distinct from cost reductions from experience curve effects. https://hbr.org/1994/03/how-pg-built-a-brand

3. **Q:** What organizational and managerial changes were identified as necessary to sustain and fully capitalize on experience curve benefits at the denim plant?  
   **A:** Sustained benefits required implementing quarterly data tracking, incentive compensation linked to cost performance, and managing a portfolio of short-, medium-, and long-term cost-reduction projects. These systems helped instill constancy of purpose, maintain momentum, and embed continuous improvement beyond the initial breakthrough.

4. **Q:** Why is the experience curve considered a "potentially dangerous idea," and what caution does Zhao hint at regarding its use?  
   **A:** The danger lies in complacency from initial cost reductions leading to poor management of overhead and neglecting structural business changes, which can result in spiraling overhead costs and eventual stagnation. Managers may ignore broader system redesigns or incentive structures that are vital to sustain gains, potentially leading to false security and financial risk.

5. **Q:** How did the experience curve concept influence strategic outcomes for the denim plant's industry structure over the longer term?  
   **A:** The improved cost position and margin growth allowed the denim plant’s owner to acquire competitors exiting the industry at low prices, consolidating market share. All plants in the system achieved solid margins despite poor industry conditions, demonstrating how experience curve-led cost advantage and constancy of purpose can reshape market competition and industry structure.

6. **Q:** According to Zhao, what key challenges arise when a customer, profit, or business model changes, and how does this relate to yesterday's success systems?  
   **A:** The main challenge is mental inertia; deeply successful companies have difficulty imagining or adopting new models because they are heavily invested in past success systems. This leads to stagnation or bankruptcy if they cannot evolve in response to shifting value in the marketplace—a phenomenon Zhao links to the concept of value migration.  
   **External example:** Blockbuster's failure to adapt its video rental model in response to streaming services exemplifies this challenge. https://hbr.org/2017/03/blockbusters-failure-to-adapt

7. **Q:** What is the difference between managing cost reductions in a manufacturing-oriented company versus a luxury consumer products company, according to the text?  
   **A:** In manufacturing companies where cost of goods is a large part of revenue (e.g., 70%), focus on experience curve learning and cost reductions is critical to competitive advantage. Luxury product companies with low cost-of-goods percentages (e.g., 20%) gain advantage mainly from scale effects like purchasing power and marketing efficiencies tied to relative market share rather than experience curve cost improvements.  
   **External example:** Apple’s luxury device ecosystem derives competitive advantage more from brand scale and pricing than from production cost reductions. https://hbr.org/2015/06/how-apple-creates-the-value-chain

8. **Q:** What specific management tools and systems did Steve find missing in applying experience curve principles initially, and why are these important?  
   **A:** Steve noted no system for quarterly data-tracking, no incentive compensation linked to cost performance, and no structured project timing to balance short-, medium-, and long-term opportunities. These are important because they institutionalize continuous improvement, align behaviors with cost goals, and sustain experience curve benefits beyond initial insight.  
   **External example:** GE’s use of balanced scorecards and incentive compensation drives continuous operational improvement. https://balancedscorecard.org/resources/bsc-resources-articles/success-stories-ge

9. **Q:** What role did "constancy of purpose" play in the long-term success of the denim plant, and how is it connected to Deming's philosophy?  
   **A:** Constancy of purpose ensured consistent focus on cost reduction, quality, and continuous improvement over years, preventing distraction or abandonment of the experience curve strategy. This approach aligns with Deming’s principle that sustained management commitment and purpose are critical to systemic performance improvement and competitive advantage.  
   **External example:** Toyota’s long-term commitment to the Toyota Production System reflects constancy of purpose for quality and cost leadership. https://www.lean.org/WhoWeAre/NewsArticleDocuments/LPSS_LW_TPS_Superiority.pdf

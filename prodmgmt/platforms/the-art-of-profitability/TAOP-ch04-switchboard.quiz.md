1. **Q:** What is the fundamental insight of the Switchboard Profit model as explained through Michael Ovitz's career, and how does building "critical mass" contribute to profitability?
   **A:** The Switchboard Profit model is founded on organizing and controlling a sufficiently large concentration of talent, stories, and studios so that a talent agent gains leverage by representing multiple key players simultaneously. Building critical mass—representing around 15 to 20 percent of talent—creates an upward spiral where studios have limited alternatives and stars benefit from increased chances of being part of successful packages, resulting in greater bargaining power, more deal flow, and profitability that is many times higher than traditional individual representation.

2. **Q:** Describe the three key steps Zhao outlines for building a Switchboard and explain why each is necessary but individually insufficient.
   **A:** Step one is packaging talent—assembling key creative individuals like actors and directors; step two is securing a source of stories (e.g., through a literary agent) to supply content; step three (the critical mass or number) involves representing a large enough portion of talent so that studios and artists must deal with the agent. Each step alone is insufficient because packaging without stories lacks substance, having stories without talent lacks execution, and representing few individuals doesn’t create leverage—only combining all three drives the power and profitability of the Switchboard.

3. **Q:** How does the Switchboard Profit model affect the agent’s fee structure and volume of deals compared to traditional models, and what is the resulting impact on profitability?
   **A:** By representing complete packages, the agent’s fee increases because they negotiate larger deals (e.g., $1.2 million instead of $500,000) and can push prices higher due to their leverage (possibly $1.5 million or more). Simultaneously, the likelihood and frequency of successful deals increase, potentially doubling or tripling deal volume. The combined effect is a 7 to 10 times increase in profitability per unit of effort and time compared to traditional individual representation.

4. **Q:** What teaching strategy does Zhao employ when he recreates the problem of the Switchboard Profit model from scratch alongside Steve, and what is the pedagogical significance of this method?
   **A:** Zhao deliberately reproaches the problem himself to mirror the student's challenges, embodying the position of a learner to empathize and better teach. This approach emphasizes the importance of struggling through problems firsthand to foster deep understanding and to avoid shortcuts that prevent true learning. It illustrates that mastery involves retracing logical steps, assumptions, and calculations meticulously.

5. **Q:** How does Zhao frame the difficulty and progression of mastering the Switchboard Profit concepts, and what metaphor does he use to motivate Steve?
   **A:** Zhao compares mastering the Switchboard Profit to climbing Mount Everest, emphasizing it is very challenging and requires starting with small, manageable steps rather than aiming directly for the summit. He motivates Steve by pointing out that although the final goal is daunting, they are already significantly advanced (3,000 feet up), and focusing on the next immediate step is critical for progress.

6. **Q:** According to the document, why does Zhao assign Steve the books *Power to Burn* and *Innumeracy*, and what specific tasks does he require Steve to complete related to these readings?
   **A:** Zhao assigns *Power to Burn* to study Michael Ovitz’s career in depth, especially his development of the Switchboard model, while *Innumeracy* is assigned to build Steve’s essential arithmetic skills needed for profitability calculations. Zhao requires Steve not only to read specified chapters but also to solve every math problem and invent additional problems of similar nature, fostering arithmetic competence foundational to understanding profit math.

7. **Q:** What does the interaction about the height of Mount Everest reveal about Zhao’s philosophy on learning and business challenges?
   **A:** The interaction illustrates Zhao’s belief that knowing the full scale of a challenge can be discouraging, so it is better to focus on incremental progress. Just as a climber does not ascend Everest in one step but gradually through stages, business and learning success come from concentrating on attainable next steps rather than being overwhelmed by the ultimate goal.

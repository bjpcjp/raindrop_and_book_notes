1. **Q:** What were the three profit models Marc Geron developed or perfected during his career, and how did each address a distinct business challenge?
   **A:** Marc Geron's three profit models were Quality (focused on upstream problem prevention in manufacturing), Field Force Morale (improving salesforce effectiveness via reorganization and incentive compensation), and Blockbuster Profit (focusing R&D efforts on developing a few high-profit blockbuster products with rigorous project selection and risk management).
   **External example:** Toyota's focus on quality through the Toyota Production System parallels Geron’s upstream quality model by preventing defects early in manufacturing. (https://www.toyota-global.com/company/vision_philosophy/toyota_production_system/)

2. **Q:** How did Marc Geron transform the R&D approach at Agri-Chem, and what critical insight differentiates profitable R&D from antiprofit R&D according to the text?
   **A:** Geron focused resources on a few high-potential blockbuster projects while neglecting trivial ones, introduced backup compounds to manage risk, and engaged external advisors and customers for targeted insights. Profitable R&D has clear, valuable targets aligned with market willingness to pay, whereas antiprofit R&D lacks such focus or addresses trivial markets.
   **External example:** Pfizer’s targeted R&D into blockbuster drugs like Lipitor, following focused research with clear market value, exemplifies profitable R&D management. (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5091169/)

3. **Q:** What challenges and organizational behaviors did Marc Geron encounter and overcome when implementing his Blockbuster Profit model, and what management strategies did he employ?
   **A:** Geron faced resistance from entrenched interests, misaligned priorities, and cultural inertia. He asserted firm leadership (“line-drawing”), imposed new meeting and reporting standards, set clear priorities, used data-informed challenges, and developed internal confidence to sustain focus on high-value projects despite uncertainty.
   **External example:** Elon Musk’s turnaround at Tesla involved asserting leadership, streamlining projects, and insisting on clear technical and financial goals amid company resistance. (https://hbr.org/2018/01/what-elon-musk-did-to-turn-around-tesla)

4. **Q:** In the dialogue between Steve and Zhao, what lessons about introducing innovative ideas in established organizations are highlighted, particularly regarding stakeholder concerns and company culture?
   **A:** Innovative ideas must be framed considering existing stakeholders’ perspectives, such as dealers in Steve’s telecom proposal, since ignoring their interests can alienate key revenue sources. Understanding company culture, historical decisions, and realistic business positions is essential before proposing change.
   **External example:** Kodak’s failure to leverage digital camera innovation due to ignoring existing business model dependencies demonstrates the importance of stakeholder and cultural awareness. (https://hbr.org/2012/07/kodaks-downfall-was-not-due-to-technology)

5. **Q:** How does the concept of “front-end loading” as presented in the text relate to effective project idea generation and knowledge building, and why is it crucial in the context of developing blockbuster products?
   **A:** Front-end loading involves intense, early-stage knowledge acquisition to build an evolving, structured framework that integrates new information effectively over time. This deep immersion early in the process supports informed decision-making and reduces downstream uncertainty critical for blockbuster R&D success.
   **External example:** The iterative, research-heavy approach at 3M during development of the Post-It note reflects front-end loading by investing heavily in early idea exploration. (https://www.3m.com/3M/en_US/post-it/)

6. **Q:** What paradox does Steve identify in Zhao’s recounting of Marc Geron’s career, and how does Zhao explain the difficulty of applying hindsight lessons to real-time business decisions?
   **A:** Steve sees a paradox of “human foolishness” where brilliant management leads to internal politics and eventual firing. Zhao explains that mistakes are clearer with hindsight, but difficult to avoid in real time due to complexity, emotions, and unfolding events challenging ideal rationality.
   **External example:** The fall of Nokia despite leadership successes highlights how external market shifts and internal dynamics create paradoxical outcomes unclear amid unfolding events. (https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-29389314)

7. **Q:** According to the text, what is the significance of organizational self-confidence in the success of a blockbuster profit model, and how did it evolve under Geron’s leadership?
   **A:** Organizational self-confidence shifts the dominant mindset from “We can’t” to “We probably will,” enabling bolder goal setting and sustained effort despite risk. Geron built this confidence through early wins, transparent management, and consistent follow-through, which energized the team to pursue ambitious projects.
   **External example:** Google's culture fosters self-confidence by encouraging ambitious projects and “moonshots,” driving innovation success. (https://rework.withgoogle.com/print/guides/5721312655835136/)

8. **Q:** Why did Marc Geron’s success ultimately lead to his dismissal, and what does this reveal about the relationship between outstanding divisional performance and corporate politics?
   **A:** Geron’s continuous success spotlighted underperforming divisions and challenged the status quo, creating resentment among Swiss corporate leaders who felt threatened. His push for biotechnology acquisitions was resisted, illustrating that exceptional performance can provoke political backlash that undermines innovators.
   **External example:** Steve Jobs was ousted from Apple in 1985 partly due to internal politics despite his visionary leadership. (https://www.britannica.com/biography/Steve-Jobs)

9. **Q:** How does Zhao plan to enhance Steve’s learning experience, and what literary reference does he use to symbolize this approach?
   **A:** Zhao intends to design Steve’s experience to unlock his potential through innovative, experiential learning rather than just stories. He references Ezra Pound’s dictum “Make it new,” symbolizing a fresh, creative approach to teaching practical business knowledge.
   **External example:** Experiential learning programs at Harvard Business School embody “making it new” by immersing students in real-world challenges rather than passive learning. (https://www.hbs.edu/mba/academic-experience/Pages/default.aspx)

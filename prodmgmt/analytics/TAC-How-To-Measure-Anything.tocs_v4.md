- **Introduction**
  - **How to Measure Anything**
    - Doug Hubbard completed 55 major risk/return analysis projects including difficult measurements.  
    - The need for measuring difficult things motivated the writing of this book.  
    - The book was scheduled for release in July 2007 by John Wiley & Sons.  
    - A sneak preview presents many methods discussed in the book.  
    - For more information, see [Hubbard Decision Research](http://www.TACadvisory.com).  

- **Examples of Measurements**
  - **Case Studies**
    - The EPA assessed the Safe Drinking Water Information System, identifying unnoticed risks leading to a $15 million NPV improvement.  
    - The US Marine Corps forecasted battlefield fuel use, realizing $50 million savings annually by reducing unnecessary inventory.  
    - American Express analyzed ROI of a dedicated test network, improving net benefit by $2 million via prioritized replacements.  
    - These cases show tangible benefits from measuring previously intangible elements.  
  - **Additional Examples**
    - Measurements covered risks such as IT risk, obsolescence, and security value.  
    - They included valuation of life, endangered species preservation, public health, IQ loss, and information availability.  
    - Also discussed are future phenomena like space tourism demand and productivity impacts.  
    - The examples demonstrate a broad applicability of measurement concepts across domains.  

- **Measurement Concepts**
  - **Measurement Muses**
    - Eratosthenes measured the Earth’s circumference with 1% accuracy.  
    - Enrico Fermi used "Fermi Questions" to estimate uncertain quantities and nuclear bomb yield.  
    - Emily Rosa published a scientific experiment at age 11 disproving "therapeutic touch."  
    - These individuals exemplify creative and effective measurement of intangible quantities.  
  - **Illusions of Intangibles**
    - The perceived impossibility of measurement arises from misunderstandings of measurement’s concept, object, and methods.  
    - This illusion is common in the “.com” mindset confronting intangibles.  
    - Reference article: [Everything Is Measurable](https://www.cio.com/article/2446714/measurement-in-the-enterprise.html) by Hubbard.  
  - **Pre-Measurement Questions**
    - Essential questions before measurement include: Why measure, how much is currently known, and what is the value of additional information.  
    - These guide decision-making and measurement design.  
  - **Why Measure?**
    - Use case: EPA needed to calculate ROI of Safe Drinking Water Information System to prioritize upgrades.  
    - Linked system effects to relevant impacts via spreadsheet modeling.  
    - Demonstrates that measurement is problem-driven and purposeful.  
  - **Uncertainty, Risk & Measurement**
    - Measurement reduces uncertainty about a quantity through observation.  
    - Uncertainty and risk are modeled statistically, including ROI risk with probability ranges.  
    - Measurement theory defines measurement as observation causing information gain.  
  - **Assessing Current Knowledge**
    - People can learn to subjectively assess their uncertainty with training as short as three hours.  
    - Improved calibration reduces estimation errors significantly.  
    - Calibrated subjective estimates correlate well with observed measurements.  
  - **Measurement Value**
    - Value of information equals cost of being wrong times chance of being wrong.  
    - Thresholds within measurement ranges often determine information value.  
    - The concept of "worst" and "best" bounds in confidence intervals influences decision impact.  
  - **IT Measurement Inversion**
    - Typical measurements focus on costs (development and maintenance) more than benefits.  
    - Benefits and chance of cancellation are often least measured but most relevant to economic decisions.  
    - Hubbard critiques this inversion in articles such as [The IT Measurement Inversion](https://www.cio.com/article/2438281/the-it-measurement-inversion.html).  

- **Measurement Methods**
  - **Observation and Action**
    - After defining what to measure and its worth, observations should be made to reduce uncertainty.  
    - The "Nike Method" suggests starting observations immediately rather than being hindered by perceived difficulties.  
  - **Sampling Power**
    - Sampling methods can measure effectively with fewer data points than expected.  
    - Examples include population estimation of fish and counting wartime German tanks.  
    - Sampling reduces data collection costs and improves efficiency.  
  - **Math-less Statistics Table**
    - Most measurements derive from samples and generating confidence intervals.  
    - A simplified table enables easy computation of 90% confidence intervals without complex calculations.  
  - **Measuring to Threshold**
    - Measurement value often lies in assessing if a quantity meets a critical threshold rather than exact magnitude.  
    - Asking "Is X enough?" is usually more practical than "How much is X?"  
  - **Bayesian Methods**
    - Bayesian statistics update prior knowledge with new information.  
    - Calibrated human judgment is naturally "subjectively Bayesian."  
    - Bayesian approaches can improve measurement accuracy and decision-making.  
  - **Improving Human Judgment**
    - The Lens Model enhances expert intuition by structuring observations to reduce error.  
    - It consistently matches or surpasses expert accuracy across various application domains including finance, psychology, education, and medicine.  
    - Demonstrates that systematic approaches improve judgment reliability.  
  - **Prediction Markets**
    - Simulated trading markets generate probabilities for uncertain events.  
    - Studies confirm effectiveness even without monetary incentives.  
    - Markets aggregate diverse opinions into useful probabilistic predictions.  
    - See research by Servan-Schreiber et al., Electronic Markets, 2004.  
  - **Applied Information Economics (AIE)**
    - AIE provides a structured model implemented in diverse scenarios where intangibles dominate decisions.  
    - The process involves defining decisions, selecting/calibrating estimators, collecting/analyzing new data, and evaluating expected value of perfect information (EVPI).  
    - This iterative approach supports ongoing evaluation and course corrections.  

- **Conclusions and Further Resources**
  - **Final Tips**
    - Understand uncertainty, risk, and information value quantitatively.  
    - Assume prior measurements exist and you have more data than perceived.  
    - Fewer data points can suffice to reduce uncertainty economically.  
    - Avoid "exception anxiety" that stops data collection; act promptly instead.  
  - **Additional Information**
    - Numerous articles in CIO magazine and InformationWeek cover measurement and IT risk/value.  
    - Book website www.howtomeasureanything.com includes examples, spreadsheets, and forums.  
    - Readers are encouraged to contribute examples to “The Measurement Challenge.”

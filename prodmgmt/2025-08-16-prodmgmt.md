The Price Sensitivity Meter (PSM) is a market technique for determining
consumer price preferences. It was introduced in 1976 by Dutch economist
Peter van Westendorp. The technique has been used by a wide variety of
researchers in the market research industry. The PSM approach has been a
staple technique for addressing pricing issues for the past 20 years. It
historically has been promoted by many professional market research
associations in their training and professional development programs.
The PSM approach continues to be used widely throughout the market
research industry and descriptions can be easily found in many market
research websites.

At most small and medium-sized e-commerce retailers, prices are
typically set and updated in an ad hoc fashion without one clear owner.
The process often starts by using a gross margin target, followed by
some comparison with competitors, and then some adjustments from there.
Many of these retailers would quickly admit that this isn't an optimal
strategy, and that they are likely leaving money on the table --- and
they're often right. The authors' experience with price testing has
shown that there is actually a significant amount of money left on the
table when pricing is left un-optimized.

Developing large-scale datasets has been critical in computer vision and
natural language processing. These datasets, rich in visual and textual
information, are fundamental to developing algorithms capable of

enhancing machine learning models, particularly those tasked with
deciphering the complex interplay between visual elements in images and
their corresponding textual descriptions. A significant challenge in
this field is the need for large-scale, accurately annotated datasets.
These are essential for training models but are often not publicly

Planning poker, also called Scrum poker, is a consensus-based, gamified
technique for estimating, mostly used for timeboxing in Agile
principles. In planning poker, members of the group make estimates by
playing numbered cards face-down to the table, instead of speaking them
aloud. The cards are revealed, and the estimates are then discussed. By
hiding the figures in this way, the group can avoid the cognitive bias
of anchoring, where the first number spoken aloud sets a precedent for
subsequent estimates.

::: card-section
Businesses are bound to make mistakes and disappoint their customers.
But how you build your apology message and your careful attention to
executing it appropriately can make the difference between losing those
customers or increasing their loyalty. When delivered well, your apology
message can improve the customer relationship to the point where it is
stronger than if the mistake had never happened --- a phenomenon known
as the service recovery paradox. In this article, the author outlines
five steps for writing an effective apology message, and explains why
it's important to share the apology process internally and with external
stakeholders. It not only shows vulnerability from the organization, but
also shows other customers that the company can be relied upon in times
of distress.

Some fans were outraged when man-of-the-people Bruce Springsteen charged
more than \$5,000 per seat for his upcoming concert. The high prices

customers' expectation that they deserve a discount, and the fact that
high prices will raise expectations about quality and service.

Whether or not you should pursue a catalog strategy is a question that
deserves significant thought. As digital marketing becomes more complex,
it may make a lot of sense to send out correctly designed catalogs to
the right customers. For e-commerce retailers without physical stores,
catalogs can effectively mimic stores' sensory experiences to enhance
customer affinity. For multichannel retailers, by understanding the
channel preferences of current customers through transactional data,
multichannel retailers can add an effective catalog marketing channel to
their store and e-commerce channel strategies.

If you\'re building a product, you have to be great at saying No. Not
\'maybe\' or \'later\'. The only word is No. Building a great product
isn\'t about creating tons of tactically useful features which are
tangentially related. It\'s about delivering a cohesive product with
well defined parameters.

For an aspiring product manager (PM), there are three primary
considerations when evaluating the role: core competencies, emotional
intelligence (EQ), and company fit. The best PMs have mastered the core
competencies, have a high EQ, and work for the right company for them.
The last requires thinking about the level of technical skill the
company requires, its philosophy of the PM role, the stage of the
company, and the relationship you'll have with senior management.

What consumers truly value can be difficult to pin down and
psychologically complicated. But universal building blocks of value do
exist, creating opportunities for companies to improve their performance
in existing markets or break into new markets. In the right
combinations, the authors' analysis shows, those elements will pay off
in stronger customer loyalty, greater consumer willingness to try a
particular brand, and sustained revenue growth. Three decades of
experience doing consumer research and observation for corporate clients
led the authors---all with Bain & Company---to identify 30 "elements of
value." Their model traces its conceptual roots to Abraham Maslow's
"hierarchy of needs" and extends his insights by focusing on people as
consumers: describing their behavior around products and services. They
arrange the elements in a pyramid according to four kinds of needs, with
"functional" at the bottom, followed by "emotional," "life changing,"
and then "social impact" at the peak. The authors provide real-world
examples to demonstrate how companies have used the elements to grow
revenue, refine product design to better meet customers' needs, identify
where customers perceive strengths and weaknesses, and cross-sell
services.

::: card-section
A technology advantage isn't enough to build an enduring enterprise SaaS
company because at the core, all SaaS software share the same
architecture. A relational database stores data and a web site presents
the data. This is true for CRM (Salesforce), marketing automation
(Marketo), email (Exchange), content management systems (Sharepoint) and
so on. Because SaaS apps use standard databases, engineers can easily
transfer the data from one database to another. I'm greatly simplifying
here because differences in architecture may exist, but in principle
it's simple to extract, transform and load data from one relational
database into another.

[The Most Effective Price Discovery Question for Your Startup by
\@ttunguz](http://tomtunguz.com/price-discovery)
:::

::: card-section
Pricing is one of the most challenging decisions for any startup. One of
the simplest ways of discovering customer willingness to pay is simply
to ask them. At first blush, that might seem a reasonable and effective
solution, it is prone to wild inaccuracy. Absolute pricing judgments are
hard without reference points. For example: How much would you be
willing to pay for a new iPhone? It's a very challenging question to
answer in the abstract.

Over the course of the past year, many writers have offered their
perspectives on Uber's dynamic pricing strategy. Perhaps the only
consistency is that people have deeply passionate views on this topic.
However, there are still many misperceptions about how the model works,
and the purpose of this post is to clarify some of those misperceptions.
I am an Uber investor and board member, and therefore expect that many
will dismiss these thoughts as naked bias. But consider that as a result
of my role I have access to more information that might enable a deeper

:::

::: card-section
Why do companies routinely succumb to the lure of rebranding? The
answer, say A.G. Lafley and Roger L. Martin, the authors of "Customer
Loyalty Is Overrated," is rooted in serious misperceptions about the
nature of competitive advantage---namely, that companies need to
continually update their business models, strategies, and communications
to respond to the explosion of options that sophisticated consumers
face. Research suggests that what makes competitive advantage truly
sustainable is helping consumers avoid having to make a choice. They
choose the leading product in the market primarily because that is the
easiest thing to do. And each time they select it, its advantage
increases over that of the products or services they didn't choose,
creating what the authors call cumulative advantage. Lafley and Martin
offer guidance for building cumulative advantage: Become popular early.
Back in 1946, Procter & Gamble gave away a box of Tide with every
washing machine sold in America. Design for habit. When P&G introduced
Febreze, consumers liked it but didn't use it much. The problem, it
turned out, was that the product came in what looked like a
glass-cleaner bottle, so users kept it under the sink. When the company
redesigned the bottle so that customers would keep it in a more visible
spot, they ended up using it more often. Innovate inside the brand.
Efforts to "relaunch" brands can lead people to break their habits.
Changes in product features should be introduced in a way that retains
cumulative advantage. For customers, "improved" is much more comfortable
than "new." Keep communication simple. A clever ad may win awards, but
if its message is too complex, it will backfire.

In many ways, online marketplaces are the perfect business model. Since
they facilitate transactions between independent suppliers and customers
rather than take possession of and responsibility for the products or
services in question, they have inherently low cost structures and fat
gross margins. They are highly defensible once established, owing to
network effects. Yet online marketplaces remain extremely difficult to
build, say Andrei Hagiu of Harvard Business School and venture
capitalist Simon Rothman of Greylock Partners. Most entrepreneurs and
investors attribute this to the challenge of quickly attracting a
critical mass of buyers and suppliers. But it is wrong to assume that
once a marketplace has overcome this hurdle, the sailing will be smooth.
Several other important pitfalls can threaten marketplaces: growing too
fast too early; failing to foster sufficient trust and safety; resorting
to sticks, rather than carrots, to deter user disintermediation; and
ignoring the risks of regulation. This article draws on company examples
such as eBay, Lending Club, and Airbnb to offer practical advice for
avoiding those hazards.

Five of the 10 most valuable companies in the world today---Apple,
Alphabet, Amazon, Facebook, and Microsoft---derive much of their worth
from their multisided platforms, which facilitate interactions or
transactions between parties. Many MSPs are more valuable than companies
in the same industries that provide only products or services: For
instance, Airbnb is now worth more than Marriott, the world's largest
hotel chain. However, companies that weren't born as platform businesses
rarely realize that they can---at least partially---turn their offerings
into one, say the authors. And even if they do realize it, they often
wander in the dark searching for a strategy to achieve this
transformation. In this article, Hagiu and Altman provide a framework
for doing so. They lay out four specific ways in which products and
services can be turned into platforms and examine the strategic
advantages and pitfalls of each: (1) opening the door to third parties;
(2) connecting customers; (3) connecting products to connect customers;
and (4) becoming a supplier to a multisided platform. These ideas can be
used by physical as well as online businesses.

The ability to get issues on the table and work through them
constructively is critical to having a healthy culture. Managers can
normalize productive conflict on your team by using an exercise to map
out the unique value of each role and the tensions that should exist
among them. Draw a circle and divide that circle into enough wedges to
represent each role on your team. For each role, ask: What is the unique
value of this role on this team? On which stakeholders is this role
focused? What is the most common tension this role puts on team
discussions? Answer those questions for each member of the team, filling
in the wedges with the answers. As you go, emphasize how the different
roles are supposed to be in tension with one another. With heightened
awareness and a shared language, your team will start to realize that
much of what they have been interpreting as interpersonal friction has
actually been perfectly healthy role-based tension.

'The Problem with...' series covers controversial topics related to
efforts to improve healthcare quality, including widely recommended but
deceptively difficult strategies for improvement and pervasive problems
that seem to resist solution. The '5 whys' technique is one of the most
widely taught approaches to root-cause analysis (RCA) in healthcare. Its
use is promoted by the WHO,1 the English National Health Service,2 the
Institute for Healthcare Improvement,3 the Joint Commission4 and many
other organisations in the field of healthcare quality and safety. Like
most such tools, though, its popularity is not the result of any
evidence that it is effective.5--8 Instead, it probably owes its place
in the curriculum and practice of RCA to a combination of pedigree,
simplicity and pedagogy. In terms of pedigree, '5 whys' traces its roots
back to the Toyota Production System (TPS).9 It also plays a key role in
Lean10 (a generic version of TPS) as well as Six Sigma,11 another
popular quality improvement (QI) methodology. Taiichi Ohno describes '5
whys' as central to the TPS methodology:The basis of Toyota\'s
scientific approach is to ask why five times whenever we find a problem
... By repeating why five times, the nature of the problem as well as
its solution becomes clear. The solution, or the how-to, is designated
as '1H.' Thus, 'Five whys equal one how' (5W=1H). (ref. 9, p. 123) This
quote also makes the case for the technique\'s simplicity. Asking 'why'
five times allows users to arrive at a single root cause that might not
have been obvious at the outset. It may also inspire a single solution
to address that root cause (though it is not clear that the '1H' side of
the equation has been adopted as widely). The pedagogical argument for

Dyson almost launched a robot vacuum. Back in 2001, after three years in
development. Its first effort, shown to the British public in London
looked nothing (and we mean nothing) like the eventual 360 Eye unveiled
today. Sixteen years is a long time in tech. The DC06, as it was called,
never made it past home-trial stages in 2012 \-- apparently too pricey
and heavy. Between then and now, technology got better. A lot better. At
the Tokyo launch of its new robot vacuum, Sir James Dyson himself, told
us how it all came together, and why it\'s not his native UK, but Japan,
that\'ll get to buy it first.

Editor\'s note: Victor Belfor is the vice president of business
development at Influitive. He recently started angel investing and
mentoring at 500 startups. As products mature, companies continue to
compete in heated battles with their competitors by adding more features
and more functionality. However, a lot of customers would prefer fewer
features because extra features tend to make products clunky and
difficult to use. Still, companies become feature-producing machines.

Editor\'s Note: The following is a guest post by Simon Rothman of
Greylock Partners. Rothman is particularly passionate about Marketplace
technology (Etsy, Kickstarter, Airbnb, etc) and how to garner success in
that category. Marketplaces are endemic to the consumer web: Largely
popularized by eBay, we\'ve recently seen quite a few variations on the
theme, like young guns Etsy, oDesk, Airbnb, and Kickstarter. Old or new,
the two elements that bind all marketplaces are network effects (a good
thing) and the chicken-and-egg problem (not such a good thing).

Editor\'s note:¬†Roman Stanek is CEO and founder of GoodData. Lately, in
Silicon Valley and its counterparts around the world, disappointment has
ruled the halls of companies that had a huge impact with consumers, but
then fizzled as investments when they went public---Facebook's and
Zynga's IPOs being the most notorious examples. Attention quickly moved
from the consumer to the enterprise market, where Splunk, Palo Alto
Networks, Workday, and LinkedIn are all humming along just fine.
Entrepreneurs seeking to sell to enterprise customers should recognize
that the business-to-business (B2B) market, especially with respect to
IT, plays by a different set of rules than the business-to-consumer
(B2C) space.

We've all watched from the sidelines as companies have come out in a
burst of glory, and then, two years later, spent their venture capital,
lost their user base, and failed to monetize. This begs the question -
what are the factors that drive a company's survival, differentiate it,
and ultimately make it a winner? In today's online world,
personalization is increasingly making or breaking companies. The
companies that win are the ones making personalization a key company
value -- not just a feature. In the early days of the web, consumers
were happy just to gain access to information. However, as technology
became more sophisticated, and as more consumers and companies came
online, we quickly moved out of the access age and into a state of
information overload, often leaving consumers frustrated and confused.
Companies that helped consumers cut through the clutter to reveal
relevant information had a critical and sustainable competitive
advantage in their respective areas. The concept of relevance is
critical to the success of Google, for example.

"Viral marketing is not a marketing strategy," Andrew Chen wrote back in
2007. "Successful viral products don't have viral marketing bolted on
once the product has been developed. It's not a marketing strategy.
Instead, it's designed into the product from the very beginning as part
of the fundamental architecture of the experience."

Credit where it\'s definitely due: this post was inspired by a Twitter
conversation with Box CEO Aaron Levie. Don\'t look now, but something
remarkable is happening. Instagram had twelve employees when it was
purchased for \$700 million; all of its actual computing power was
outsourced to Amazon Web Services. Mighty ARM has only 2300 employees,
but there are more than 35 billion ARM-based chips out there. They do no
manufacturing; instead they license their designs to companies like
Apple, who in turn contract with companies like TSMC for the actual
fabrication. Nest Labs and Ubiquiti are both 200-employee hardware
companies worth circa \$1 billion\...who subcontract their actual
manufacturing out to China.

Editor's Note: Nir Eyal blogs about the intersection of psychology,
technology, and business at¬†NirAndFar.com. Sangeet Paul Choudary
analyzes business models for network businesses at Platformed.info.
Traditionally defined as a system where each new user on the network
increases the value of the service for all others, a network effect
often creates a winner-takes-all dynamic, ordaining one dominant company
above the rest.

:::

::: card-section
Competitive poaching refers to the practice of bidding on ads for a
competitor's search terms, in order to poach customers searching for
that brand. It's a common tactic in the world of digital ads --- but is
it effective? The author shares results from the first-ever empirical
study of this practice, which found that poaching can work well for
higher-end brands, but may backfire for lower-end or mass market
offerings. Specifically, the study found that when an ad poached
customers who searched for a high-end brand, users clicked on it more,
but when an ad poached a low-end or mass market target, users were less
likely to click. Of course, the author notes that clickthrough rate is
just one metric, and there may be other ways in which a poaching
campaign could be harmful or beneficial. But these findings can help
marketers add a bit of science to the art that is digital advertising,
helping them to optimize campaigns for their unique products and
customers.

preferences. To get a clearer, more-complete picture, we studied the
actual decisions made by 1,500 apparel and footwear shoppers in the
United States. Our five most surprising findings: shopping is not yet
truly omnichannel; when consumers buy online, they purchase more; online
journeys take longer than in-store; brand stores and website generate
higher spend than multibrand stores; and, very often, consumers just
want to buy new versions of an item they already own.

The most consistent sales leader I've worked with hit plan 27
consecutive quarters. How can a sales leader develop similar
repeatability? Much goes into it here are the reports he used to manage
his team at the board level. The PQR (pipeline-to-quota) funnel is
first. Pipeline is the total value of the accounts within a stage or
later. Quota is the aggregate quota on the street for the quarter.
Divide P by Q to get PQR.

[Five Reasons to Sell End-to-End Products in Early Markets by
\@ttunguz](https://tomtunguz.com/selling-end-to-end-products-in-early-markets)
:::

::: card-section
In early and developing markets, selling complete products is often a
superior go to market strategy, rather than selling an innovation in a
layer in the stack. This is true for five reasons. First, for early
customers to generate value from a novel technology, that technology
must solve a business problem completely. End-to-end products do that.
Layers in the stack don't. They optimize existing systems. In early
markets, customers want to buy a car, not a better camshaft.

Profit desert customers --- small, low-profit customers often numbering
in the tens of thousands --- are an important business segment in most
companies. They often amount to about 50--80% of customers and consume
about 40--60% of the company's costs. In some companies, they're
assigned to territory reps as low-revenue "C" accounts, which distracts
the reps from selling more lucrative business. In all companies, they
create costly complexity in functions ranging from order-taking to
fulfilment to after-sales service and returns because these customers
are numerous and often inexperienced. The best way to manage your profit
desert customers is to cluster them under a unified management structure
--- a profit desert customer team --- rather than having them scattered
in sales reps' portfolios throughout the company. This team should be
composed of specialized sales and marketing managers who are solely
focused on this customer segment. The author presents three steps these
managers should take to bring latent profits to the bottom line.

in your target market haven't heard of your business or the kind of

your last financing. Do you spend aggressively to create the category or

Most innovation managers know that few of their initiatives will
succeed, so they keep multiple projects running at the same time and
create processes for quickly separating winners from losers. One popular

portfolio at former handset maker Sony Ericsson. They found that that
the conventional use of stage gates can actually be part of the problem,
impeding project discontinuation in counterintuitive ways.

In an age where customer word of mouth can quickly go viral, managers
can take five proactive actions to get the most lift out of their
customers' good reviews and minimize the bad ones. For positive reviews,
managers should delay their response and--when they do respond-- make
sure the response is generic and short. The authors found that more
customized responses --- perceived as promotional and thus viewed as
disingenuous --- negatively affected future reviews. For negative
reviews, it's important to quickly respond to every one with a tailored
solution to the specific complaint.

Steven Rogelberg, a professor at UNC Charlotte, has spent decades
researching workplace meetings and reports that many of them are a waste
of time. Why? Because the vast majority of managers aren't trained in or
reviewed on effective meeting management. He explains how leaders can
improve meetings --- for example, by welcoming attendees as if they were
party guests or banning use of the mute button on conference calls ---
and how organizations can support these efforts with better practices
and policies, from creating meeting-free days to appointing a Chief
Meeting Officer. Rogelberg is the author of the book "The Surprising
Science of Meetings: How You Can Lead Your Team to Peak Performance" and
the HBR article "Why Your Meetings Stink --- And What To Do About It."

Every website or PWA you build should automate as much prospecting and
selling as possible. The only thing is that visitors enter websites with
various mindsets, depending on which part of the buying stage they're
at. This means that you can't just take every person who enters the site
through the same path. You have to design a custom sales funnel (or
pathway) for each kind of buyer. In this article, Suzanna Scacca will
tell you what you need to keep in mind.

Increasingly, companies are using experiments to guide them in their
decision making---but many are still missing opportunities, or are
failing to implement experiments well. When it comes to the rollout of
new products, one particularly effective new kind of experiment involves
randomizing the introduction of new products across a set of markets.
Uber used this strategy before rolling out its Express Pool service, and
Airbnb did the same before rollout out a new landing-page design. In
both cases, the companies gathered data that allowed them to roll out
their products with confidence that they would succeed---as indeed they
did. Many companies, even those not in the tech sector, can benefit from
this kind of experimentation, especially if they follow a few basic
guidelines.

How does Netflix get away with releasing its movies in theaters on the
same day it makes them available for "free" on its streaming platform?
The answer is that Netflix is pursuing a fundamentally different
business model from everyone else in the industry. Netflix is not in the
business of selling individual movies to many different customers.
Instead, it's in the business of selling many different movies to
individual customers---in bundles. Bundled subscriptions allow Netflix
to practice a different kind of price discrimination from the movie
studios. The company doesn't have to figure out how much a consumer
values any individual movie on the service. The bundle does that for
them---very profitably.

Orbitz, the travel website, offers slightly different prices to
customers who are shopping¬†through its app¬†or a computer, and even
between two different users on the same platform. Some of this may be
due to experimentation and testing, but it's also a sign that web
retailers are using technology to try to offer personalized pricing ---
a practice some might consider a form of price profiling. The goal of
this practice is to try to identify an individual's willingness to pay
and adjust the price upward or downward to maximize profits. It's
something shoppers should be aware of as more purchases are made online.

When Hulu was launched, in 2008, it had the backing of three major
motion-picture studios---21st Century Fox, NBC Universal, and Walt
Disney Studios/ABC Television. The service seemed poised to dominate
video distribution online---but today it ranks only 8th among streaming
services, far behind Netflix, YouTube, and Amazon Prime Video. What
happened? From its inception, it turns out, the service faced two major
obstacles to success: its ownership structure, which discouraged its
members from sharing their most valuable content; and the organizational
structure of its members, which focused on their traditional model of
doing business, rather than on streaming. But streaming is the future of
the entertainment industry, the authors write, and Hulu will only
succeed if it acknowledges that truth and adapts its business model
accordingly---which, promisingly, it has begun to do.

gave their strategic plans to each other, would it really make a
difference? In 1986, Amar Bhide wrote "Hustle as Strategy" for the
Harvard Business Review. At the time, he was an assistant professor at

take full advantage must be a high priority. Indeed, everyone must be
able to contribute to improving data quality, interpreting analyses, and
conducting their own experiments. It will take decades for the public
education systems to churn out enough people with the needed skills ---
far too long for companies to wait. Fortunately, managers, aided by a
senior data scientist engaged for a few hours a week can introduce five
powerful "tools" that will help their teams start to use analytics to
solve important business problems.

:::

::: card-section
The U.S. grocery industry has reached an uncertain crossroads, facing
competition from many sources, but especially German discount stores
ALDI and LIDL, who are aggressively expanding across the United States.
Whether U.S. retailers will maintain their market share hinges on how
they use private-label products (also called white-label goods or store
brands) to fight back. In France, grocers were able to repel ALDI and
LIDL by offering private-label goods that were both affordable and high
quality, but in the UK, retailers chose to offer super-budget
private-label items. They might have been cheap, but they were very
low-quality, and consumers punished them. The U.S. doesn't have a lot of
experience with private-label goods, so American retailers will have to
come up to speed quickly if they hope to maintain their advantage.

Product expansion is often used as a path to growth, but it can have
unintended consequences for other aspects of the business --- including
the customer experience central to the company's value proposition.
Indeed, current trends are moving away from broad offerings in many
industries. A recent poll had 64% of consumers saying they would pay
more for a simpler, more convenient experience. The trick is, growth
strategies have to fit the company's current context, especially its
brand promise and its target market. Once the company has a strategy to
fit the context, it can sequence out the various steps to implement it.
For example, McDonald's had known for years that customers wanted
all-day breakfast, but to be able to offer it, it first had to
streamline and revamp its kitchens.

:::

::: card-section
Cost-plus pricing is a lot like the romance novel genre, in that it's
widely ridiculed yet tremendously popular.¬†The idea behind cost-plus
pricing is straightforward. The seller calculates all costs, fixed and
variable, that have been or will be incurred in manufacturing the
product, and then applies a markup percentage to these costs to estimate
the asking price. Though currently out of fashion among pricing experts
(for good reason), there are sometimes strategic and pragmatic
reasons¬†to¬†use cost-plus pricing.¬†When implemented with forethought and
prudence, cost-plus pricing can lead to powerful differentiation,
greater customer trust, reduced risk of price wars, and steady,
predictable profits for the company.

Rather than simply selling products, more and more companies have begun
to sell projects, helping customers achieve a specific goal on a
specific timeframe. For example, consider the evolution of medical
device maker Philips. After more than a century of profitable existence,
the company has become an intricate, blurred matrix organization.
Accountabilities and responsibilities were shared between products,
segments, countries, regions, functions, and headquarters. To simplify
this convoluted and archaic organization structure, as well as protect
its products against commoditization, Philips put projects at center
stage. Shifting from selling products or experiences to selling projects
requires fundamental shifts across your business --- but in a rapidly
evolving industry, it can make your company more nimble and responsive
to the market.

The Price Sensitivity Meter (PSM) is a market technique for determining
consumer price preferences. It was introduced in 1976 by Dutch economist Peter
van Westendorp. The technique has been used by a wide variety of researchers
in the market research industry. The PSM approach has been a staple technique
for addressing pricing issues for the past 20 years. It historically has been
promoted by many professional market research associations in their training
and professional development programs. The PSM approach continues to be used
widely throughout the market research industry and descriptions can be easily
found in many market research websites.

At most small and medium-sized e-commerce retailers, prices are typically set
and updated in an ad hoc fashion without one clear owner. The process often
starts by using a gross margin target, followed by some comparison with
competitors, and then some adjustments from there. Many of these retailers
would quickly admit that this isn’t an optimal strategy, and that they are
likely leaving money on the table — and they’re often right. The authors’
experience with price testing has shown that there is actually a significant
amount of money left on the table when pricing is left un-optimized.

Developing large-scale datasets has been critical in computer vision and
natural language processing. These datasets, rich in visual and textual
information, are fundamental to developing algorithms capable of understanding
and interpreting images. They serve as the backbone for enhancing machine
learning models, particularly those tasked with deciphering the complex
interplay between visual elements in images and their corresponding textual
descriptions. A significant challenge in this field is the need for large-
scale, accurately annotated datasets. These are essential for training models
but are often not publicly accessible, limiting the scope of research and
development. The ImageNet and OpenImages datasets, containing human-annotated

Planning poker, also called Scrum poker, is a consensus-based, gamified
technique for estimating, mostly used for timeboxing in Agile principles. In
planning poker, members of the group make estimates by playing numbered cards
face-down to the table, instead of speaking them aloud. The cards are
revealed, and the estimates are then discussed. By hiding the figures in this
way, the group can avoid the cognitive bias of anchoring, where the first
number spoken aloud sets a precedent for subsequent estimates.

Businesses are bound to make mistakes and disappoint their customers. But how
you build your apology message and your careful attention to executing it
appropriately can make the difference between losing those customers or
increasing their loyalty. When delivered well, your apology message can
improve the customer relationship to the point where it is stronger than if
the mistake had never happened — a phenomenon known as the service recovery
paradox. In this article, the author outlines five steps for writing an
effective apology message, and explains why it’s important to share the
apology process internally and with external stakeholders. It not only shows
vulnerability from the organization, but also shows other customers that the
company can be relied upon in times of distress.

should keep in mind when adjusting prices, including the need for clear
communications, longtime customers’ expectation that they deserve a discount,
and the fact that high prices will raise expectations about quality and
service.

Whether or not you should pursue a catalog strategy is a question that
deserves significant thought. As digital marketing becomes more complex, it
may make a lot of sense to send out correctly designed catalogs to the right
customers. For e-commerce retailers without physical stores, catalogs can
effectively mimic stores’ sensory experiences to enhance customer affinity.
For multichannel retailers, by understanding the channel preferences of
current customers through transactional data, multichannel retailers can add
an effective catalog marketing channel to their store and e-commerce channel
strategies.

For an aspiring product manager (PM), there are three primary considerations
when evaluating the role: core competencies, emotional intelligence (EQ), and
company fit. The best PMs have mastered the core competencies, have a high EQ,
and work for the right company for them. The last requires thinking about the
level of technical skill the company requires, its philosophy of the PM role,
the stage of the company, and the relationship you’ll have with senior
management.

[The 30 Elements of Consumer Value: A Hierarchy](https://hbr.org/2016/09/the-
elements-of-value)

![cover
image](https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2016/07/R1609C_CAM.jpg)

What consumers truly value can be difficult to pin down and psychologically
complicated. But universal building blocks of value do exist, creating
opportunities for companies to improve their performance in existing markets
or break into new markets. In the right combinations, the authors’ analysis
shows, those elements will pay off in stronger customer loyalty, greater
consumer willingness to try a particular brand, and sustained revenue growth.
Three decades of experience doing consumer research and observation for
corporate clients led the authors—all with Bain & Company—to identify 30
“elements of value.” Their model traces its conceptual roots to Abraham
Maslow’s “hierarchy of needs” and extends his insights by focusing on people
as consumers: describing their behavior around products and services. They
arrange the elements in a pyramid according to four kinds of needs, with
“functional” at the bottom, followed by “emotional,” “life changing,” and then
“social impact” at the peak. The authors provide real-world examples to
demonstrate how companies have used the elements to grow revenue, refine
product design to better meet customers’ needs, identify where customers
perceive strengths and weaknesses, and cross-sell services.

[The 3 Competitive Defenses of Enduring SaaS Companies by
@ttunguz](http://tomtunguz.com/saas-barriers-to-entry)

A technology advantage isn’t enough to build an enduring enterprise SaaS
company because at the core, all SaaS software share the same architecture. A
relational database stores data and a web site presents the data. This is true
for CRM (Salesforce), marketing automation (Marketo), email (Exchange),
content management systems (Sharepoint) and so on. Because SaaS apps use
standard databases, engineers can easily transfer the data from one database
to another. I’m greatly simplifying here because differences in architecture
may exist, but in principle it’s simple to extract, transform and load data
from one relational database into another.

Since Benchmark’s investment in Ebay 15 years ago, we have been fascinated by
online marketplaces. Entrepreneurs accurately recognize that the connective
tissue of the Internet provides an opportunity to link the players in a
particular market, reducing friction in both the buying and selling
experience. For example, my car tax check is an online platfrom that allows
you to book a slot for a complete history and guidance of your car taxes and
other details. The arrival of the smartphone amplifies these opportunities, as

In a casino, the term “rake” refers to the commission that the house earns for
operating a poker game. With each hand, a small percentage of the pot is
scraped off by the dealer, which in essence becomes the “revenue” for the
casino. While casinos use the term “rake,” a plethora of interesting word
choices exist which all describe the same thing – keeping a little bit of the
revenue for the company that is running the service. Examples include
“commission,” “fee,” “toll,” “tax,” “vig” or “vigorish,” “juice,” “the take”,
and “graft” (although this last one is typically associated with…

[The Most Effective Price Discovery Question for Your Startup by
@ttunguz](http://tomtunguz.com/price-discovery)

Pricing is one of the most challenging decisions for any startup. One of the
simplest ways of discovering customer willingness to pay is simply to ask
them. At first blush, that might seem a reasonable and effective solution, it
is prone to wild inaccuracy. Absolute pricing judgments are hard without
reference points. For example: How much would you be willing to pay for a new
iPhone? It’s a very challenging question to answer in the abstract.

[Six Principles for Making New Things](http://paulgraham.com/newthings.html)

[Customer Loyalty Is Overrated](https://hbr.org/2017/01/customer-loyalty-is-
overrated)

![cover
image](https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2016/11/R1701B_LAFLEY.jpg)

Why do companies routinely succumb to the lure of rebranding? The answer, say
A.G. Lafley and Roger L. Martin, the authors of “Customer Loyalty Is
Overrated,” is rooted in serious misperceptions about the nature of
competitive advantage—namely, that companies need to continually update their
business models, strategies, and communications to respond to the explosion of
options that sophisticated consumers face. Research suggests that what makes
competitive advantage truly sustainable is helping consumers avoid having to
make a choice. They choose the leading product in the market primarily because
that is the easiest thing to do. And each time they select it, its advantage
increases over that of the products or services they didn’t choose, creating
what the authors call cumulative advantage. Lafley and Martin offer guidance
for building cumulative advantage: Become popular early. Back in 1946, Procter
& Gamble gave away a box of Tide with every washing machine sold in America.
Design for habit. When P&G; introduced Febreze, consumers liked it but didn’t
use it much. The problem, it turned out, was that the product came in what
looked like a glass-cleaner bottle, so users kept it under the sink. When the
company redesigned the bottle so that customers would keep it in a more
visible spot, they ended up using it more often. Innovate inside the brand.
Efforts to “relaunch” brands can lead people to break their habits. Changes in
product features should be introduced in a way that retains cumulative
advantage. For customers, “improved” is much more comfortable than “new.” Keep
communication simple. A clever ad may win awards, but if its message is too
complex, it will backfire.

In many ways, online marketplaces are the perfect business model. Since they
facilitate transactions between independent suppliers and customers rather
than take possession of and responsibility for the products or services in
question, they have inherently low cost structures and fat gross margins. They
are highly defensible once established, owing to network effects. Yet online
marketplaces remain extremely difficult to build, say Andrei Hagiu of Harvard
Business School and venture capitalist Simon Rothman of Greylock Partners.
Most entrepreneurs and investors attribute this to the challenge of quickly
attracting a critical mass of buyers and suppliers. But it is wrong to assume
that once a marketplace has overcome this hurdle, the sailing will be smooth.
Several other important pitfalls can threaten marketplaces: growing too fast
too early; failing to foster sufficient trust and safety; resorting to sticks,
rather than carrots, to deter user disintermediation; and ignoring the risks
of regulation. This article draws on company examples such as eBay, Lending
Club, and Airbnb to offer practical advice for avoiding those hazards.

Funnel optimization for web3 companies will become critical to their success.

techniques, like incentivized referral, improve the economics but still tally
19 month payback periods. A year-and-a-half might be fine for a SaaS company
selling a $50k to $100k ARR product, but long-term viability demands achieving
3-6 month paybacks of modern web2 consumer companies. Why are the payback

Five of the 10 most valuable companies in the world today—Apple, Alphabet,
Amazon, Facebook, and Microsoft—derive much of their worth from their
multisided platforms, which facilitate interactions or transactions between
parties. Many MSPs are more valuable than companies in the same industries
that provide only products or services: For instance, Airbnb is now worth more
than Marriott, the world’s largest hotel chain. However, companies that
weren’t born as platform businesses rarely realize that they can—at least
partially—turn their offerings into one, say the authors. And even if they do
realize it, they often wander in the dark searching for a strategy to achieve
this transformation. In this article, Hagiu and Altman provide a framework for
doing so. They lay out four specific ways in which products and services can
be turned into platforms and examine the strategic advantages and pitfalls of
each: (1) opening the door to third parties; (2) connecting customers; (3)
connecting products to connect customers; and (4) becoming a supplier to a
multisided platform. These ideas can be used by physical as well as online
businesses.

The ability to get issues on the table and work through them constructively is
critical to having a healthy culture. Managers can normalize productive
conflict on your team by using an exercise to map out the unique value of each
role and the tensions that should exist among them. Draw a circle and divide
that circle into enough wedges to represent each role on your team. For each
role, ask: What is the unique value of this role on this team? On which
stakeholders is this role focused? What is the most common tension this role
puts on team discussions? Answer those questions for each member of the team,
filling in the wedges with the answers. As you go, emphasize how the different
roles are supposed to be in tension with one another. With heightened
awareness and a shared language, your team will start to realize that much of
what they have been interpreting as interpersonal friction has actually been
perfectly healthy role-based tension.

‘The Problem with…’ series covers controversial topics related to efforts to
improve healthcare quality, including widely recommended but deceptively
difficult strategies for improvement and pervasive problems that seem to
resist solution. The ‘5 whys’ technique is one of the most widely taught
approaches to root-cause analysis (RCA) in healthcare. Its use is promoted by
the WHO,1 the English National Health Service,2 the Institute for Healthcare
Improvement,3 the Joint Commission4 and many other organisations in the field
of healthcare quality and safety. Like most such tools, though, its popularity
is not the result of any evidence that it is effective.5–8 Instead, it
probably owes its place in the curriculum and practice of RCA to a combination
of pedigree, simplicity and pedagogy. In terms of pedigree, ‘5 whys’ traces
its roots back to the Toyota Production System (TPS).9 It also plays a key
role in Lean10 (a generic version of TPS) as well as Six Sigma,11 another
popular quality improvement (QI) methodology. Taiichi Ohno describes ‘5 whys’
as central to the TPS methodology:The basis of Toyota's scientific approach is
to ask why five times whenever we find a problem … By repeating why five
times, the nature of the problem as well as its solution becomes clear. The
solution, or the how-to, is designated as ‘1H.’ Thus, ‘Five whys equal one
how’ (5W=1H). (ref. 9, p. 123) This quote also makes the case for the
technique's simplicity. Asking ‘why’ five times allows users to arrive at a
single root cause that might not have been obvious at the outset. It may also
inspire a single solution to address that root cause (though it is not clear
that the ‘1H’ side of the equation has been adopted as widely). The
pedagogical argument for …

Reddit has never been a place where you could necessarily connect one user
with one account. Parody accounts are commonplace -- to a fault if you ask
some -- and there have been more than one fiasco involving users who pretend
to be different people with different accounts; it's crazy. It's also
extremely fitting. Why? Because when Reddit was first started, it was

Dyson almost launched a robot vacuum. Back in 2001, after three years in
development. Its first effort, shown to the British public in London looked
nothing (and we mean nothing) like the eventual 360 Eye unveiled today.
Sixteen years is a long time in tech. The DC06, as it was called, never made
it past home-trial stages in 2012 -- apparently too pricey and heavy. Between
then and now, technology got better. A lot better. At the Tokyo launch of its
new robot vacuum, Sir James Dyson himself, told us how it all came together,
and why it's not his native UK, but Japan, that'll get to buy it first.

As products mature, companies continue to compete in heated battles with their
competitors by adding more features and more functionality. However, a lot of
customers would prefer fewer features because extra features tend to make
products clunky and difficult to use. Still, companies become feature-

oDesk, Airbnb, and Kickstarter. Old or new, the two elements that bind all

Editor's note: Roman Stanek is CEO and founder of GoodData. Lately, in Silicon
Valley and its counterparts around the world, disappointment has ruled the
halls of companies that had a huge impact with consumers, but then fizzled as
investments when they went public—Facebook’s and Zynga’s IPOs being the most
notorious examples. Attention quickly moved from the consumer to the
enterprise market, where Splunk, Palo Alto Networks, Workday, and LinkedIn are
all humming along just fine. Entrepreneurs seeking to sell to enterprise
customers should recognize that the business-to-business (B2B) market,
especially with respect to IT, plays by a different set of rules than the
business-to-consumer (B2C) space.

its spammy SEO tactics disguised as an affiliate program. Called out, exposed
and now punished by Google, the site's traffic has tanked. But Rap Genius,
thanks in part to that $15 million investment, will probably recover. They'll
clean up their links, make amends, and maybe even get back into Google's good
graces. End users will once again land on Rap Genius's pages, many of them
none the wiser for the time the site spent in the penalty box. Other startups
may not be as lucky.

We’ve all watched from the sidelines as companies have come out in a burst of
glory, and then, two years later, spent their venture capital, lost their user
base, and failed to monetize. This begs the question - what are the factors
that drive a company’s survival, differentiate it, and ultimately make it a
winner? In today’s online world, personalization is increasingly making or
breaking companies. The companies that win are the ones making personalization
a key company value – not just a feature. In the early days of the web,
consumers were happy just to gain access to information. However, as
technology became more sophisticated, and as more consumers and companies came
online, we quickly moved out of the access age and into a state of information
overload, often leaving consumers frustrated and confused. Companies that
helped consumers cut through the clutter to reveal relevant information had a
critical and sustainable competitive advantage in their respective areas. The
concept of relevance is critical to the success of Google, for example.

[When Keyword Poaching Pays Off](https://hbr.org/2022/05/when-keyword-

![cover
image](https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2022/05/May22_13_1055306876.jpg)

Competitive poaching refers to the practice of bidding on ads for a
competitor’s search terms, in order to poach customers searching for that
brand. It’s a common tactic in the world of digital ads — but is it effective?
The author shares results from the first-ever empirical study of this
practice, which found that poaching can work well for higher-end brands, but
may backfire for lower-end or mass market offerings. Specifically, the study
found that when an ad poached customers who searched for a high-end brand,
users clicked on it more, but when an ad poached a low-end or mass market
target, users were less likely to click. Of course, the author notes that
clickthrough rate is just one metric, and there may be other ways in which a
poaching campaign could be harmful or beneficial. But these findings can help
marketers add a bit of science to the art that is digital advertising, helping
them to optimize campaigns for their unique products and customers.

Retail has been constantly reinventing itself, and participants race to keep
up with what feels like a series of epic shifts in consumer preferences. To
get a clearer, more-complete picture, we studied the actual decisions made by
1,500 apparel and footwear shoppers in the United States. Our five most
surprising findings: shopping is not yet truly omnichannel; when consumers buy
online, they purchase more; online journeys take longer than in-store; brand
stores and website generate higher spend than multibrand stores; and, very
often, consumers just want to buy new versions of an item they already own.

shoppers and do a better job of marketing to them. In the context of search

[Five Reasons to Sell End-to-End Products in Early Markets by
@ttunguz](https://tomtunguz.com/selling-end-to-end-products-in-early-markets)

In early and developing markets, selling complete products is often a superior
go to market strategy, rather than selling an innovation in a layer in the
stack. This is true for five reasons. First, for early customers to generate
value from a novel technology, that technology must solve a business problem
completely. End-to-end products do that. Layers in the stack don’t. They
optimize existing systems. In early markets, customers want to buy a car, not
a better camshaft.

Customers](https://hbr.org/2021/11/theres-still-profit-potential-in-your-low-

Profit desert customers — small, low-profit customers often numbering in the
tens of thousands — are an important business segment in most companies. They
often amount to about 50–80% of customers and consume about 40–60% of the
company’s costs. In some companies, they’re assigned to territory reps as low-
revenue “C” accounts, which distracts the reps from selling more lucrative
business. In all companies, they create costly complexity in functions ranging
from order-taking to fulfilment to after-sales service and returns because
these customers are numerous and often inexperienced. The best way to manage
your profit desert customers is to cluster them under a unified management
structure — a profit desert customer team — rather than having them scattered
in sales reps’ portfolios throughout the company. This team should be composed
of specialized sales and marketing managers who are solely focused on this
customer segment. The author presents three steps these managers should take
to bring latent profits to the bottom line.

Suppose you’ve started a company that’s creating a category. Most buyers in
your target market haven’t heard of your business or the kind of software you
sell. There’s no budget line item, no Magic Quadrant, no G2 High Performer
Award, no conference. You have an idea, a vast blue ocean in front of you, and
a pile of greenbacks stashed in a bank account from your last financing. Do
you spend aggressively to create the category or conserve capital, knowing
education will take time?

20 years ago Apple seized music, and turned it into a lever for its broader
business. It failed to do the same to TV, and lost control of music, but won
massively in games, where it now makes more money than the entire global
digital music industry. Now, perhaps, it’s looking at advertising.

Most innovation managers know that few of their initiatives will succeed, so
they keep multiple projects running at the same time and create processes for
quickly separating winners from losers. One popular way to make decisions
about what stays and what goes is the use of stage gates. Yet, even with stage
gates, firms struggle to kill bad projects. The authors undertook a decade-
long review of the product development portfolio at former handset maker Sony
Ericsson. They found that that the conventional use of stage gates can
actually be part of the problem, impeding project discontinuation in
counterintuitive ways.

2020 was the year East Fork ceramics planned to become profitable. Now, that's
likely no longer on the table, but the company is using a new model to better
handle its balance sheet: pre-sales. Now, new product lines will all be for
sale before they're manufactured, as a way to get capital in as early as
possible.

In an age where customer word of mouth can quickly go viral, managers can take
five proactive actions to get the most lift out of their customers’ good
reviews and minimize the bad ones. For positive reviews, managers should delay
their response and–when they do respond– make sure the response is generic and
short. The authors found that more customized responses — perceived as
promotional and thus viewed as disingenuous — negatively affected future
reviews. For negative reviews, it’s important to quickly respond to every one
with a tailored solution to the specific complaint.

Steven Rogelberg, a professor at UNC Charlotte, has spent decades researching
workplace meetings and reports that many of them are a waste of time. Why?
Because the vast majority of managers aren’t trained in or reviewed on
effective meeting management. He explains how leaders can improve meetings —
for example, by welcoming attendees as if they were party guests or banning
use of the mute button on conference calls — and how organizations can support
these efforts with better practices and policies, from creating meeting-free
days to appointing a Chief Meeting Officer. Rogelberg is the author of the
book “The Surprising Science of Meetings: How You Can Lead Your Team to Peak
Performance” and the HBR article “Why Your Meetings Stink — And What To Do
About It.”

Every website or PWA you build should automate as much prospecting and selling
as possible. The only thing is that visitors enter websites with various
mindsets, depending on which part of the buying stage they’re at. This means
that you can’t just take every person who enters the site through the same
path. You have to design a custom sales funnel (or pathway) for each kind of
buyer. In this article, Suzanna Scacca will tell you what you need to keep in
mind.

![cover

Increasingly, companies are using experiments to guide them in their decision
making—but many are still missing opportunities, or are failing to implement
experiments well. When it comes to the rollout of new products, one
particularly effective new kind of experiment involves randomizing the
introduction of new products across a set of markets. Uber used this strategy
before rolling out its Express Pool service, and Airbnb did the same before
rollout out a new landing-page design. In both cases, the companies gathered
data that allowed them to roll out their products with confidence that they
would succeed—as indeed they did. Many companies, even those not in the tech
sector, can benefit from this kind of experimentation, especially if they
follow a few basic guidelines.

How does Netflix get away with releasing its movies in theaters on the same
day it makes them available for “free” on its streaming platform? The answer
is that Netflix is pursuing a fundamentally different business model from
everyone else in the industry. Netflix is not in the business of selling
individual movies to many different customers. Instead, it’s in the business
of selling many different movies to individual customers—in bundles. Bundled
subscriptions allow Netflix to practice a different kind of price
discrimination from the movie studios. The company doesn’t have to figure out
how much a consumer values any individual movie on the service. The bundle
does that for them—very profitably.

Orbitz, the travel website, offers slightly different prices to customers who
are shopping through its app or a computer, and even between two different
users on the same platform. Some of this may be due to experimentation and
testing, but it’s also a sign that web retailers are using technology to try
to offer personalized pricing — a practice some might consider a form of price
profiling. The goal of this practice is to try to identify an individual’s
willingness to pay and adjust the price upward or downward to maximize
profits. It’s something shoppers should be aware of as more purchases are made
online.

When Hulu was launched, in 2008, it had the backing of three major motion-
picture studios—21st Century Fox, NBC Universal, and Walt Disney Studios/ABC
Television. The service seemed poised to dominate video distribution
online—but today it ranks only 8th among streaming services, far behind
Netflix, YouTube, and Amazon Prime Video. What happened? From its inception,
it turns out, the service faced two major obstacles to success: its ownership
structure, which discouraged its members from sharing their most valuable
content; and the organizational structure of its members, which focused on
their traditional model of doing business, rather than on streaming. But
streaming is the future of the entertainment industry, the authors write, and
Hulu will only succeed if it acknowledges that truth and adapts its business
model accordingly—which, promisingly, it has begun to do.

Data is invading every nook and cranny of every team, department, and company
in every industry, everywhere. Developing the talent needed to take full
advantage must be a high priority. Indeed, everyone must be able to contribute
to improving data quality, interpreting analyses, and conducting their own
experiments. It will take decades for the public education systems to churn
out enough people with the needed skills — far too long for companies to wait.
Fortunately, managers, aided by a senior data scientist engaged for a few
hours a week can introduce five powerful “tools” that will help their teams
start to use analytics to solve important business problems.

![cover

Price.jpg)

The U.S. grocery industry has reached an uncertain crossroads, facing
competition from many sources, but especially German discount stores ALDI and
LIDL, who are aggressively expanding across the United States. Whether U.S.
retailers will maintain their market share hinges on how they use private-
label products (also called white-label goods or store brands) to fight back.
In France, grocers were able to repel ALDI and LIDL by offering private-label
goods that were both affordable and high quality, but in the UK, retailers
chose to offer super-budget private-label items. They might have been cheap,
but they were very low-quality, and consumers punished them. The U.S. doesn’t
have a lot of experience with private-label goods, so American retailers will
have to come up to speed quickly if they hope to maintain their advantage.

Grow](https://hbr.org/2018/08/why-adding-more-products-isnt-always-the-best-

![cover

Product expansion is often used as a path to growth, but it can have
unintended consequences for other aspects of the business — including the
customer experience central to the company’s value proposition. Indeed,
current trends are moving away from broad offerings in many industries. A
recent poll had 64% of consumers saying they would pay more for a simpler,
more convenient experience. The trick is, growth strategies have to fit the
company’s current context, especially its brand promise and its target market.
Once the company has a strategy to fit the context, it can sequence out the
various steps to implement it. For example, McDonald’s had known for years
that customers wanted all-day breakfast, but to be able to offer it, it first
had to streamline and revamp its kitchens.

[When Cost-Plus Pricing Is a Good Idea](https://hbr.org/2018/07/when-cost-

![cover

Cost-plus pricing is a lot like the romance novel genre, in that it’s widely
ridiculed yet tremendously popular. The idea behind cost-plus pricing is
straightforward. The seller calculates all costs, fixed and variable, that
have been or will be incurred in manufacturing the product, and then applies a
markup percentage to these costs to estimate the asking price. Though
currently out of fashion among pricing experts (for good reason), there are
sometimes strategic and pragmatic reasons to use cost-plus pricing. When
implemented with forethought and prudence, cost-plus pricing can lead to
powerful differentiation, greater customer trust, reduced risk of price wars,
and steady, predictable profits for the company.

Many online retailers unintentionally train consumers to expect discounts.
Clothing stores are amongst the worst offenders. Constant discounting makes
full-price shoppers believe they’re being overcharged. They often won’t shop
until the next sale, which leads to a vicious cycle. It is a rare company that
doesn’t get asked for discounts. In this post, I'll review 10 ways to offer

Rather than simply selling products, more and more companies have begun to
sell projects, helping customers achieve a specific goal on a specific
timeframe. For example, consider the evolution of medical device maker
Philips. After more than a century of profitable existence, the company has
become an intricate, blurred matrix organization. Accountabilities and
responsibilities were shared between products, segments, countries, regions,
functions, and headquarters. To simplify this convoluted and archaic
organization structure, as well as protect its products against
commoditization, Philips put projects at center stage. Shifting from selling
products or experiences to selling projects requires fundamental shifts across
your business — but in a rapidly evolving industry, it can make your company
more nimble and responsive to the market.

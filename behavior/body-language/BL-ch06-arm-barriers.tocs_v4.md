    - Clenched fists combined with folded arms indicate a hostile and potentially aggressive attitude.

    - One arm crosses the body to touch or hold the other arm, forming a partial barrier.  
    - The “holding hands with oneself” gesture relives childhood emotional security under stress.  
  - **Disguised Arm-Cross Gestures**
    - Disguised arm crosses involve touching objects like handbags, watches, or adjusting clothing to hide nervousness.

    - Faster smoke exhalations correspond to stronger positive or negative feelings.
    - Observing smoke direction during sales can help assess customer decisions and tailor responses.

- **Gestures with Glasses**
  - **Glasses-in-Mouth**
    - Placing a glasses arm in the mouth is a reassurance gesture linked to infantile security behaviors.
    - This gesture is used to stall or delay decisions, especially near a negotiation close.
    - Cleaning lenses repeatedly also functions as a stalling mechanism.
    - After such gestures, putting glasses back on means the person wants to review information; folding and putting glasses away signals ending the conversation.

    - Glasses wearers should remove glasses when speaking and wear them to listen to maintain control and reduce tension.

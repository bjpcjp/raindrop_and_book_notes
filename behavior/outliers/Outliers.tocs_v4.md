- **Introduction**
  - **The Roseto Mystery**
    - Roseto, Pennsylvania, was a close-knit immigrant town where inhabitants showed remarkably low rates of heart disease in the 1950s.
    - Diet, exercise, genetics, and locality were ruled out as causes for this health anomaly.
    - The protective social structure, including strong community ties, multigenerational households, and cultural unity, explained Roseto’s health outcomes.
    - Stewart Wolf and John Bruhn’s research expanded medical perspectives on health to consider cultural and community factors.

- **Part One: Opportunity**
  - **Chapter One: The Matthew Effect**
    - Canadian junior hockey displays a striking relative age effect, where players born near the January 1 cutoff date disproportionately dominate elite teams.
    - Early-born children benefit from maturity advantages resulting in better coaching, more practice, and selection for elite teams.
    - Similar relative age effects exist in other sports such as baseball and European soccer, and in educational outcomes, affecting achievement and college attendance.
    - These disparities stem from accumulative advantages (“Matthew Effect”) where initial small differences compound into bigger successes.

  - **Chapter Two: The 10,000-Hour Rule**
    - Bill Joy, a prominent computer scientist, accumulated extensive practice time by immersing himself in computing from an early age at the University of Michigan.
    - The chapter introduces the concept that extensive, deliberate practice (about 10,000 hours) is essential for world-class expertise.
    - Early opportunities and access to resources play a crucial role in enabling such prolonged practice.
    - The principle applies broadly across fields such as music, sports, and professions.

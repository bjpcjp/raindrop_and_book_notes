The chapter examines the cultural factors, particularly high power distance and mitigated speech, that contributed to a series of Korean Air crashes in the 1980s and 1990s, culminating in the 1997 crash of flight 801. It contrasts these issues with Western cockpit communication norms, highlighting how Korean Air's eventual safety transformation involved confronting its cultural legacy and adopting English-based Crew Resource Management to improve assertiveness and communication among pilots.

- **Claypan** — A hard clay floor of a rice paddy, engineered to prevent water seepage and maintain optimum water levels for rice growth.  
- **Congee** — A white rice porridge commonly eaten in South China for breakfast, lunch, or dinner.  
- **Cultural legacies** — Traditions and practices inherited over generations that influence behaviors, attitudes, and skills in modern society.  
- **Dike** — A barrier built around rice paddies to control irrigation water levels.  
- **Effort-reward relationship** — The direct correlation between how hard rice farmers work and the yield they harvest.  
- **Fence gate (in irrigation)** — A controllable opening in irrigation channels to regulate water flow into rice fields.  
- **Fixed rent system** — A land tenure system where landlords collect a fixed share of the harvest but give farmers autonomy over cultivation.  
- **Glorious misconception** — A productive misunderstanding or error that leads to deeper learning and eventual conceptual insight.  
- **Human memory loop** — A brief cognitive period (~two seconds) during which digits can be most easily held in working memory.  
- **Number-naming system** — The linguistic structure and pattern of naming numbers, affecting ease of learning arithmetic.

- **Persistence** — The quality of continuing effort and focus in solving complex problems, critical in mastering mathematics.  
- **Pearl River Delta** — A region in Southern China historically shaped by rice cultivation and rapid industrialization.  
- **Paddy (rice paddy)** — Small, typically terraced fields built for growing rice, requiring precise water and soil management.  
- **Rice agriculture (“skill-oriented” farming)** — Intensive farming requiring intricate, hands-on management rather than mechanized labor.  
- **Slopes (in math)** — A measurement in algebra representing the steepness of a line; vertical lines have undefined slopes.  
- **Stable incentives (in rice farming)** — Economic systems that reward farmers directly for increased effort and better crop yields.  
- **Stanilas Dehaene** — Author of *The Number Sense*, referencing cognitive advantages in Asian number systems.  
- **Structural regularity (in counting systems)** — Logical and predictable numeric patterns that facilitate quicker math learning.  
- **Symbolic representation (math language)** — The embedding of mathematical operations within language, making arithmetic easier to perform mentally.  
- **Task perseverance** — The cultural and individual tendency to maintain focus on difficult or tedious tasks, such as answering long questionnaires or solving math problems.  
- **TEMSS (Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study)** — An international assessment comparing countries’ student achievement in math and science.  
- **Terraces (rice terraces)** — Man-made, stepped sections on mountainsides or plains created for rice cultivation.  
- **Virtuous cycle (in education)** — A positive feedback loop where enjoyment of math leads to harder work and increased achievement.  
- **Work ethic (in Asian cultures)** — A cultural emphasis on diligence, discipline, and long work hours, shaped historically by rice farming demands.

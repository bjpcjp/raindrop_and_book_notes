- **Addressee** — The person to whom a message or communication is directed.  
- **Air Traffic Control (ATC)** — The service responsible for directing aircraft on the ground and through controlled airspace.  
- **Avianca flight 052** — A Colombian airplane that crashed in 1990 due to fuel exhaustion linked to communication and procedural errors.  
- **Black box** — Cockpit voice and data recorder used to investigate airplane crashes.  
- **Boeing 747 "classic"** — A specific model of Boeing 747 aircraft involved in several Korean Air incidents.  
- **Captain** — The pilot in command of an aircraft, responsible for its operation and safety.  
- **Cultural legacy** — The inherited behaviors, norms, and communication patterns shaped by a person's culture.  
- **Crew Resource Management (CRM)** — Airline training programs designed to improve communication, teamwork, and decision-making among crew members.  
- **DME (Distance Measuring Equipment)** — Navigation aid that measures distance between aircraft and a ground station for approach procedures.  
- **Flight engineer** — A member of the flight crew responsible for monitoring and operating aircraft systems, especially in older airplanes.  
- **First officer** — The second pilot, assisting the captain and sharing flying duties.  
- **Glide scope** — A radio navigation system that provides vertical guidance to aircraft on approach to an airport.  
- **Go-around** — An aborted approach to landing, where the pilot pulls the plane up and circles for another attempt.  
- **Ground Proximity Warning System (GPWS)** — An automated system providing pilots with alerts to avoid controlled flight into terrain.  
- **Hofstede's Dimensions** — A framework for cross-cultural psychology measuring differences such as power distance, uncertainty avoidance, and individualism.  
- **Individualism-Collectivism scale** — A Hofstede dimension describing whether a culture expects individuals to look after themselves or depend on groups.  
- **Landing gear** — The wheels and associated structure used during takeoff or landing.  
- **Mitigated speech** — Communication that downplays, softens, or sugarcoats the urgency or clarity of the message.  
- **Missed approach** — A procedure when pilots discontinue an approach to landing and climb away for another attempt or diversion.  
- **Nimitz Hill** — A mountain near Guam that was impacted by the Korean Air 801 crash.  
- **Pilot fatigue** — Reduced alertness and impaired decision-making resulting from prolonged wakefulness or work hours.  
- **Power Distance Index (PDI)** — Hofstede’s measure of how much a culture respects and expects inequalities in power or hierarchy.  
- **Receiver-oriented communication** — Communication style where interpretation and meaning are primarily the responsibility of the listener.  
- **Runway six left** — A specific landing runway at Guam airport.  
- **VOR (VHF Omnidirectional Range)** — Navigation beacon allowing pilots to determine their position relative to the beacon.  
- **Visual approach** — Landing method where the pilot relies on sight rather than instruments to see the runway.  
- **Weather radar** — Onboard system detecting weather patterns and precipitation to assist pilots in avoiding storms.  
- **Wing icing** — The dangerous accumulation of ice on airplane wings that can affect flight safety.

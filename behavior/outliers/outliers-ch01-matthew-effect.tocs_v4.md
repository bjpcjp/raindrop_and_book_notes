- **1. Introduction**
  - **The 2007 Memorial Cup Hockey Game**
    - Medicine Hat Tigers and Vancouver Giants competed in the Canadian Hockey League final in May 2007.
    - The Canadian Hockey League is the premier junior hockey league globally, featuring players aged 17-19.
    - The event was nationally televised and featured notable dignitaries such as Gordon Campbell and Gordie Howe.
    - The game was intense, with Vancouver winning 3-2, determined by goals in the second and third periods.
    - For more on Canadian junior hockey, see [Canadian Hockey League](https://chl.ca).

- **2. The Myth of Individual Merit**
  - **Common Misconceptions About Success**
    - Success is often attributed solely to individual talent, personality, and hard work.
    - Cultural narratives emphasize self-made achievements, as seen in biographies and historical examples like Benjamin Franklin.
    - These perspectives overlook external factors such as upbringing, opportunities, and cultural legacies.
    - Success depends heavily on social, cultural, and temporal contexts influencing opportunities.
    - For sociological views on success, consult [Sociology of Success](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2773922).

- **3. Relative Age Effect in Hockey**
  - **January-March Birthdate Disproportion**
    - Roger Barnsley discovered a significant overrepresentation of players born in the first quarter of the year.
    - Top Canadian hockey leagues showed 40% of players born January-March; November-December births were underrepresented.
    - The January 1 cutoff date for age-class hockey in Canada creates large maturity gaps among players.
    - Older players get better coaching, more games, and more practice, amplifying initial advantages.

- **4. Relative Age Effect Beyond Hockey**
  - **Impact on Other Sports and Education**
    - Baseball in the U.S. shows similar effects with a July 31 cutoff date favoring August-born players.
    - European soccer teams also exhibit birthdate clustering around their eligibility cutoff dates.
    - Relative age influences academic grouping and achievement, as younger students score lower on standardized tests.
    - Danish schools avoid ability grouping before age ten, resulting in less pronounced relative age effects.
    - For educational impacts, see [Relative Age Effect in Education](https://www.aera.net/Publications/Journals/Educational-Researcher).

- **5. The Matthew Effect and Accumulative Advantage**
  - **Concept and Consequences**
    - The Matthew Effect describes how initial advantages lead to accumulative benefits over time.
    - Bigger, older children receive better coaching and opportunities, reinforcing their early edge.
    - Systems that separate talented individuals early exclude many late-born individuals, wasting potential talent.
    - Adjusting cutoff dates or grouping by birth month could mitigate these inequities.
    - For theoretical background, consult [Robert Merton's Matthew Effect](https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev.soc.24.1.93).

- **6. Personal Stories and Societal Impact**
  - **Example of Scott Wasden**
    - Scott Wasden, born January 4, benefited from being among the oldest in his age category.
    - His early physical maturity contributed to selection on top youth teams and high-level play.
    - His father emphasizes passion, hard work, and early opportunities as keys to success.
    - Such advantages highlight societal roles in determining success beyond individual effort.

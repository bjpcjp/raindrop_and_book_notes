Roseto, a close-knit immigrant community in Pennsylvania, exhibited remarkably low rates of heart disease and other health problems despite poor diet and lifestyle, a phenomenon attributed not to genetics or location but to the townâ€™s strong social cohesion and supportive culture. Researchers Stewart Wolf and John Bruhn found that the communal values, multigenerational living, and social connections in Roseto created a protective environment that profoundly influenced the residents' health.

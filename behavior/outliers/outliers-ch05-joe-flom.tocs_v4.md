- **Introduction to Joe Flom**
  - Joe Flom is the last living named partner of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom with a modest physical presence but significant influence.
  - He grew up in a poor Jewish immigrant family in Brooklyn during the Depression.
  - Flom entered Harvard Law School without a college degree, relying on his judgment and thinking ability.
  - Early in his career, he joined a small law firm of three partners and took whatever work came through the door.
  - For additional study, see [Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP](https://www.skadden.com)

- **The Myth and Reality of Success**
  - The common rags-to-riches story overlooks the importance of environment and opportunity in success.
  - Disadvantages such as poverty, Jewish identity during discrimination, and growing up in the Depression turned into advantages.
  - Understanding Joe Flom's rise requires examining the social ecology around his development.
  - Relevant context is provided by the book *Outliers* by Malcolm Gladwell.

- **Lesson Number One: The Importance of Being Jewish**
  - Jewish graduates like Joe Flom and Alexander Bickel faced discrimination from elite, white-shoe Wall Street law firms.
  - These firms preferred candidates with Nordic backgrounds, elite social connections, and specific physical appearances.
  - Jewish lawyers were often excluded from top-tier firms and relegated to smaller or upstart firms handling less desirable legal work.
  - White-shoe firms focused on corporate law excluding litigation and hostile takeovers, opening niches for Jewish lawyers.
  - For more on legal exclusion, see Erwin Smigel’s *The Wall Street Lawyer*.

- **Flom’s Specialization and Opportunities**
  - Flom specialized in proxy fights and hostile takeovers, areas avoided by old-line firms but critical in the 1970s-80s corporate world.
  - His firm, Skadden Arps, grew exponentially as their expertise in these emerging legal areas became highly sought.
  - White-shoe firms outsourced takeover work to firms like Skadden Arps for decades before entering the field themselves.
  - The rise of hostile takeovers created an enormous market for litigation and takeover law, rewarding early specialists.

- **Lesson Number Two: Demographic Luck**
  - Success depended critically on being born in a demographic trough, like the early 1930s, which provided educational advantages.
  - Smaller birth cohorts enjoyed better public schools, less crowded universities, and stronger job markets.
  - The Great Depression and World War II timing adversely affected earlier generations but benefited those born slightly later.
  - Example: Mort Janklow’s success contrasted with his father Maurice’s limited career due to timing and economic hardship.
  - For demographic context, see H. Scott Gordon’s analysis of birthrate effects.

- **Educational and Economic Context for 1930s Born Jewish Lawyers**
  - New York City public schools during the 1940s were among the best in the country with highly qualified teachers.
  - City College and public universities offered affordable higher education options for Jewish students.
  - Economic conditions made it easier for that generation to work their way through school and secure jobs.
  - Ted Friedman’s story illustrates this advantage through affordable education and available summer jobs.
  - Educational background crucial for legal success is documented by Diane Ravitch.

- **Lesson Number Three: The Garment Industry and Meaningful Work**
  - Early Jewish immigrants like Louis and Regina Borgenicht entered the garment industry, a major New York economic sector.
  - The garment trade was growing rapidly and provided meaningful work involving complexity, autonomy, and a clear link between effort and reward.
  - The skills and virtues developed in the garment industry primed Jewish immigrants for upward mobility into professional fields.
  - Compared to other immigrant groups, Jews brought specific occupational skills from urban trades like tailoring and dressmaking.
  - For socioeconomic history, refer to Daniel Soyer’s research on the garment industry.

- **Entrepreneurial Dimensions of the Garment Business**
  - The garment industry had a low threshold for entry, enabling small contractors to launch businesses with limited capital.
  - Jewish immigrants learned market research, manufacturing, and negotiation skills critical to entrepreneurial success.
  - Louis Borgenicht’s story shows innovation in product creation and direct cloth purchasing for cost advantage.
  - The industry allowed for growth from street peddling to ownership of factories within a few years.
  - See [Triangle: The Fire That Changed America](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2274236.Triangle) for related labor history.

- **Transgenerational Mobility of Jewish Professionals**
  - Sociological studies show descendants of immigrant garment workers became doctors, lawyers, and other professionals.
  - The meaningful work and skills fostered in immigrant families like the Borgenichts encouraged education and upward social mobility.
  - Family trees from Jewish immigrants show a progression from manual trades to law and medicine within two to three generations.
  - Joe Flom’s background exemplifies this trajectory from garment industry origins to legal prominence.
  - Further reading: Louise Farkas’s sociological family network studies.

- **The Profile of New York’s Greatest Lawyers**
  - The perfect lawyer was born around 1930, Jewish, with parents involved in the garment trade, and attended strong public schools.
  - This lawyer faced exclusion from white-shoe firms and gained valuable experience in takeover and litigation law.
  - Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz exemplifies this profile, founded by Jewish lawyers fitting these demographic and social parameters.
  - Their success aligns with the previously discussed lessons on opportunity, timing, and cultural capital.

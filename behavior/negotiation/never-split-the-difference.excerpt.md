Never Split the Difference by Chris Voss emphasizes that successful negotiation hinges on deeply understanding and empathizing with the counterpart’s emotions, needs, and perspectives, using tactical tools like calibrated questions, labeling, mirroring, and strategic use of “No” to maintain control and build trust. The approach prioritizes uncovering hidden information, managing tone and body language, and bending the other party’s reality through emotional anchoring and carefully planned bargaining to achieve optimal outcomes without splitting the difference.

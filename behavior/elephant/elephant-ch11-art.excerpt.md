Art is a costly but universal human behavior that functions as a fitness display, signaling an artist’s health, energy, and skill through the production of impractical, non-functional works that convey status and attract mates, allies, or intimidate rivals. Unlike the conventional view that values art mainly for its intrinsic properties, the fitness-display theory emphasizes extrinsic factors—such as the effort, originality, and skill involved in creation—as central to our appreciation and understanding of art.

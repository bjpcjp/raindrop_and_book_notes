Education serves not only to teach material and improve skills for future careers but also functions as a signaling mechanism to demonstrate qualities like diligence and conformity to employers, while additionally acting as a tool for societal indoctrination and preparing individuals to adapt to hierarchical and regimented modern workplaces.

Human brains often generate rationalizations—plausible but counterfeit reasons—for our own behavior to mask our true motives, a process managed by an internal "Press Secretary" module that constructs coherent explanations both for ourselves and others. This system enables strategic ignorance about our deeper impulses, leading us to deceive ourselves as part of normal cognition and social interaction.

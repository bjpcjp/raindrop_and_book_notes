      - Understanding these hidden motives aids in interpreting social interactions and institutional functions.
      - Realizing these motives improves critical reception of messages in advertising, politics, and social advice.

    - **No Direct Accusations**
      - Hidden motive explanations should be applied in first or third person, not as direct accusations.
      - Motives are complex and multifaceted; selfish and lofty motives coexist in individuals.
      - These explanations are more reliable at the species level than when applied directly to individuals.

    - **Showing Off**
      - Acknowledging uncomfortable truths about human motives can signal honesty and intellectual courage.

    - **Choosing to Behave Better**
      - Awareness of selfish motives allows deliberate mitigation or alignment with ideal motivations.
      - Sustainable self-improvement is gradual and focused on one domain at a time rather than wholesale change.
      - Aligning incentives with ideals, such as joining communities valuing effective altruism, enhances motivation.

    - **Kevin’s Alignment of Motives**
      - Positive institutional culture can align selfish and prosocial motives, reducing internal conflict.
      - Personal projects motivated by vanity illustrate tension between selfish and prosocial drives.
      - Environmental incentives shape the ease of aligning these motives.
    - **Enlightened Self-Interest**
      - Human selfishness is natural but should not be used to justify bad behavior.
      - Virtue must be defined within biological constraints, avoiding impossible nonbiological standards.
      - Ideals incentivize better behavior through reputation and social stakes, despite inevitable hypocrisy.
      - Historical and biological concepts include enlightened self-interest, indirect reciprocity, and competitive altruism.

    - **Designing Institutions**
      - Effective institutional design must account for both overt and hidden motives of participants.
      - Failure to recognize hidden goals leads to resistance and disinterest in institutional reforms.
      - Some hidden institutional functions, like wasteful signaling, may warrant reduction or elimination.
      - Diverting status-seeking behaviors toward productive activities improves collective welfare.

    - Humans cooperate remarkably well despite selfish impulses, unlike many other species.
    - Social incentives reward cooperation, service, and reputation, fostering ethical brains and societies.
    - Achievements like the moon landing demonstrate cooperative success despite selfish underlying motives.

Politics often serves as a social performance in which ordinary citizens act less out of civic virtue and more to signal loyalty to their political coalitions, motivated by social and professional incentives rather than purely altruistic or outcome-oriented reasons. This loyalty-driven behavior explains widespread voter ignorance, emotional attachment to beliefs, resistance to compromise, and the clustering of political positions along narrow ideological lines.

The book explores the idea that much of human behavior is driven by hidden, often unconscious selfish motives that we strategically deceive ourselves about to maintain social appearances. It argues that these hidden motives not only influence individual actions but also underpin the structure and inefficiencies of major social institutions, shaped by evolutionary competition for resources like mates, status, and political power.

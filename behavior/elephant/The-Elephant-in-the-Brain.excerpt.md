The book explores the idea that much of human behavior is driven by hidden, often unconscious motives centered on social competition, status, and self-deception, which shape both individual actions and societal institutions. It argues that understanding these covert agendas—our "elephant in the brain"—is essential to accurately interpreting behaviors and reforming institutions that frequently serve unacknowledged purposes alongside their stated goals.

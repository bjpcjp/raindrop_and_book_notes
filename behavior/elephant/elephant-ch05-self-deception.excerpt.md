Self-deception is an evolved mental strategy that distorts or ignores critical information to better manipulate others in social interactions, allowing individuals to gain advantages such as intimidating opponents, earning trust, or altering beliefs. This process relies on the brainâ€™s modularity, enabling some parts to maintain accurate information while others remain unaware, thereby making self-deception an effective tactic in mixed-motive social games despite its potential costs.

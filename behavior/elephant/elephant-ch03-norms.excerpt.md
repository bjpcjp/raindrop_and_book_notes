Humans uniquely develop and enforce norms through collective punishment and coalition enforcement, using language and weapons to maintain egalitarian social orders and promote cooperation while suppressing dominance. These norms, ranging from informal social conventions to strict laws, regulate behavior and intentions, supported by mechanisms like gossip, reputation, and meta-norms, enabling complex social coordination despite inherent challenges in enforcement.

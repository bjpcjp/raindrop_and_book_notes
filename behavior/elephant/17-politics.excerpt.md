Unpredictability is a powerful tool in gaining and maintaining power, as it unsettles opponents, disrupts their expectations, and keeps them off-balance, while isolation, as illustrated by historical examples like Shih Huang Ti, leads to loss of control and vulnerability by cutting one off from valuable information and allies. Effective rulers, such as Louis XIV, maintain their power by staying closely connected to their court and surroundings, ensuring they remain informed and central to all activity.

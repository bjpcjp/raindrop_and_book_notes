Religion functions as a social system that fosters community cohesion through shared rituals, costly sacrifices, and prosocial norms, which signal loyalty and facilitate cooperation while deterring cheating. Supernatural beliefs and extreme practices, such as celibacy and martyrdom, serve to reinforce group identity and status within these communities, making religion a strategic social technology rather than solely a matter of individual faith.

Human intelligence evolved primarily through intense intra-species competition in social challenges such as sex, status, and politics, leading to an evolutionary arms race where individuals constantly signal their qualities to outcompete rivals. Like redwoods competing for sunlight, humans have developed large brains and complex social behaviors to navigate these zero-sum games, although unlike redwoods, we possess the capacity to coordinate and mitigate wasteful competition through norms and cooperation.

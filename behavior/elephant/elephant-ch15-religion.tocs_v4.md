- **Animal and Human Migrations**
  - Animal migrations like monarch butterflies, wildebeests, and red crabs involve biological motives such as climate, food, and reproduction.
  - The Hajj is a unique human migration involving millions of Muslims performing religious rituals in Mecca yearly.
  - Human migrations for religion are driven by faith, not biological needs.
  - For more on migration patterns, see [Animal Migration](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/article/animal-migration).

- **The Mystery of Religion**
  - Religious behaviors often involve costly, seemingly counterproductive actions like fasting, sacrificing animals, or ritual mutilation.
  - Extreme religious practices include vows of poverty, chastity, and martyrdom.
  - People engage in these behaviors despite biological costs, raising evolutionary and social questions.
  - For further analysis, consult [The Evolution of Religion](https://www.britannica.com/topic/history-of-religion).

- **Do Beliefs Explain Behaviors?**
  - The belief-first model asserts that supernatural beliefs cause religious behaviors.
  - Many religions emphasize public ritual over private belief, with some adherents active despite disbelief.
  - Non-supernatural activities with similar social functions suggest beliefs may be secondary.
  - Belief adoption is often driven by social rather than purely psychological incentives.
  - See [Beliefs and Behavior in Religion](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/religion-behavior/).

- **Religions as Social Systems**
  - Religion functions primarily as a social system that fosters community and cooperation.
  - Social incentives, including costly rituals and norms, maintain religion as a cohesive group strategy.
  - The communal model explains religion as a team sport centered around shared practices.
  - For detailed sociology of religion, see [Durkheim on Religion](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/durkheim/).

- **Sacrifice, Loyalty, and Trust**
  - Ritual sacrifices signal loyalty and engender trust among community members.
  - Sacrifices involve various resources: food, money, health, time, status, and fertility.
  - Costly sacrifices limit cheating and increase social capital, facilitating large-scale cooperation.
  - Pilgrimages like the Hajj combine multiple sacrifices and confer higher social standing.

- **Prosocial Norms**
  - Religious norms encourage anti-theft, nonviolence, compassion, and generosity.
  - Norm enforcement includes punishment, shunning, and social monitoring.
  - Norms on sex and family shape mating strategies aligned with community structure.
  - Religious communities favor early marriage, monogamy, and high fertility to maintain cohesion.

- **Rituals of Synchrony**
  - Synchronized movement and behavior enhance trust and group solidarity.
  - Religious traditions incorporate chanting, singing, marching, and shared silence.
  - Experimental studies show synchrony increases cooperation and willingness to sacrifice.
  - Synchrony rituals are common across religions and secular institutions.
  - See [The Power of Synchrony](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2009.0882).

- **Sermons**
  - Sermons transmit communal norms and reinforce preacher and institutional authority.
  - Attending a sermon acts as a public commitment to shared values and group standards.
  - Sermons create common knowledge essential for norm enforcement and cooperation.
  - Controversial messages become normative through repeated communal acceptance.
  - For discussion, see [Role of Sermons](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3882688/).

- **Badges**
  - Badges are visible symbols marking religious group membership.
  - They can include clothing, hairstyles, jewelry, dietary rules, or ritual practices.
  - Badges signal loyalty internally and enhance trust among group members.
  - They also communicate commitment to outsiders, deterring cheating and misconduct.
  - See [Religious Badges and Identity](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-ecumenical-studies/article/abs/symbols-in-religion/3E0B44FADC9F9AAF57974D118B3A9354).

- **Supernatural Beliefs**
  - Religious beliefs serve social functions by signaling credibility and group loyalty.
  - Belief in moralizing gods encourages good behavior through anticipated supernatural punishment.
  - The internalization of these beliefs facilitates trust even without constant monitoring.
  - Doctrinal disputes often serve as markers to distinguish in-group from out-group.
  - Weird or stigmatizing beliefs act as costly signals reinforcing group solidarity.
  - For more, refer to [The Social Functions of Belief](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228172685_The_social_functions_of_beliefs).

- **Celibacy and Martyrdom**
  - Extreme religious behaviors such as celibacy and martyrdom appear biologically maladaptive.
  - These acts confer social prestige, glory, and elevated status within religious hierarchies.
  - Human instincts for social status can lead to escalating sacrifices, risking self-harm.
  - Such extremes are comparable to other costly human behaviors driven by social incentives.
  - See [Martyrdom and Social Status](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/going-beyond-intelligence/201902/the-psychology-martyrdom).

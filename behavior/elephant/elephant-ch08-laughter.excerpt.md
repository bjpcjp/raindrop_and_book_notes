Laughter is an involuntary, innate social behavior evolved as a play signal to communicate non-serious, playful intentions, helping to navigate social boundaries by signaling safety despite elements of danger or norm violation. Its involuntary nature and inherent deniability allow people to address taboo or sensitive topics while maintaining plausible deniability, revealing underlying social dynamics and personal attitudes that conscious minds often fail to grasp.

- **Affect Heuristic** — A mental shortcut where people make judgments and decisions based on their emotions and feelings rather than detailed analysis.
- **Availability** — The ease with which examples or ideas come to mind, influencing perceptions and judgments of frequency or importance.

- **Availability Entrepreneurs** — Individuals or organizations who deliberately promote worrying news to sustain public concern about a risk.
- **Biases** — Systematic deviations from rational judgment, often arising from cognitive shortcuts like heuristics.
- **CERCLA (Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act)** — U.S. legislation establishing the Superfund for cleanup of toxic waste sites, enacted partly in response to public concern over Love Canal.
- **Costs and Benefits Analysis** — A method to evaluate policies by weighing the monetary costs against the lives or life-years saved.
- **Decision Making** — The cognitive process of selecting a course of action, influenced by emotions, heuristics, and reasoning.
- **Democracy** — A system of government where policies must consider public opinion and cannot rely solely on experts.
- **Emotional Reactions** — Feelings such as fear or worry that influence judgments about risks and policy preferences.
- **Expert** — An individual with specialized knowledge or skill, often better at dealing with numerical assessments of risk but also subject to biases.
- **Fear** — A painful and debilitating emotion that can strongly influence public attitudes and policy demands.
- **High-Water Mark** — The highest recorded level of a flood used historically as a basis for disaster preparedness.
- **Judgment of Risk** — The process by which people estimate the likelihood or severity of dangers, often influenced by availability and affect.
- **Lay Judgments** — Risk assessments made by non-experts, typically more influenced by emotion and varied values.

- **Risk** — The concept invented by humans to understand dangers and uncertainties; it lacks a single, objective definition.
- **Risk Assessment** — The scientific process of estimating risks, including numbers of deaths or exposures.
- **Risk Regulation** — Government policies intended to manage or reduce risks, ideally based on rational cost-benefit analysis.
- **Substitution** — A cognitive bias where people answer an easier question (e.g., feelings) instead of a harder one (e.g., statistical frequencies).
- **System 1** — The fast, intuitive, and emotional part of human cognition that responds immediately to threats.
- **Terrorism** — Acts aimed to induce fear and availability cascades despite typically low casualty numbers relative to other risks.

- **Certainty Effect** — The psychological phenomenon where outcomes that are almost certain are underweighted relative to actual certainty, causing people to value guaranteed outcomes disproportionately higher than near-certainties.  
- **Decision Weights** — Subjective weights assigned to outcomes of a prospect that differ from their actual probabilities, reflecting how people perceive and worry about risks.  
- **Diminishing Sensitivity** — The tendency for the subjective difference between two outcomes to decrease as the magnitude of those outcomes increases, affecting attitudes toward gains and losses.  
- **Expectation Principle** — A normative rule that the utility of a gamble is the average of the utilities of its outcomes, each weighted by their probability; assumes weighting decision outcomes strictly proportional to their probabilities.  
- **Fourfold Pattern** — A distinctive pattern of preferences observed in risky choices, characterized by risk aversion or risk seeking depending on the domain of gains or losses and the probabilities involved.  
- **Frivolous Litigation** — Legal claims with a low probability of success but large potential rewards, often leading to plaintiffs gambling on small chances and defendants seeking settlements to avoid unlikely large losses.  
- **Lottery Ticket Effect** — The phenomenon where people overweight small probabilities of large gains, leading them to purchase lottery tickets or take gambles with minuscule chances of winning.  
- **Mixed Emotions in Decision Making** — The coexistence of attraction to sure gains or hope for winning and the fear or aversion to loss or disappointment, driving risk preferences.  
- **Possibility Effect** — The overweighting of small probabilities of highly desirable or undesirable outcomes, leading to disproportionate attention and willingness to pay for small chances.  
- **Probability Insensitivity** — The decreased sensitivity to changes in probabilities in the intermediate range (approximately 5% to 95%), leading to a compression of decision weights compared to actual probabilities.  
- **Risk Aversion** — Preference for a sure outcome over a gamble with an equal or higher expected value, typically seen in the domain of gains.  
- **Risk Seeking** — Preference for a gamble over a sure outcome with the same or lower expected value, commonly observed in the domain of losses or small probabilities of gains.  
- **Structured Settlements** — Financial arrangements in which individuals accept less than the expected value of a lawsuit award in exchange for certainty of payment, exemplifying the certainty effect.  
- **Sure Loss** — A guaranteed negative outcome, which people tend to avoid, sometimes taking gambles with worse expected outcomes to escape it.  
- **Utility Theory (Expected Utility Theory)** — A theory positing that rational decision-makers evaluate uncertain prospects by the expected utility, calculated as a probability-weighted average of utility values.  
- **Von Neumann–Morgenstern Axioms** — Foundational principles of rational choice theory that require consistent, probability-proportional weighting of outcomes to avoid logical inconsistencies.  
- **Worry Premium** — The additional amount people are willing to pay to eliminate small risks entirely, reflecting a psychological need for certainty beyond rational expected value calculations.

Judgments arise from two cognitive systems: System 1, which continuously and effortlessly generates intuitive assessments based on basic evaluations like threat, trustworthiness, and intensity matching, and System 2, which deliberately directs attention to answer complex questions. System 1 often substitutes simpler judgments for difficult ones through mechanisms such as the mental shotgun, leading to rapid but sometimes imprecise evaluations that influence important decisions like voting and social perception.

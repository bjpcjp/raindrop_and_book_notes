- **Associative memory** — The mental system that retrieves facts and suggestions automatically to assist deliberate thinking.  
- **Artifacts** — Observations produced entirely by some aspect of the research method, such as sample size differences, rather than true effects.  
- **Bias of confidence over doubt** — The tendency to favor certainty and coherent stories over ambiguity and skepticism.  
- **Causal explanations** — Interpretations that assign a cause to an event, often inaccurately applied to chance occurrences.  
- **Causal thinking** — The human tendency to seek and attribute causes to events, even when outcomes are due to randomness.  
- **Chance** — The selection of events without causation, as part of natural randomness and statistical variation.  
- **Extreme outcomes** — Very high or very low results that are more likely to occur in small samples due to chance.  
- **Hot hand** — The illusion that a person’s success streak indicates a temporary increased ability, despite random sequences.  
- **Law of large numbers** — The principle that larger samples tend to produce results closer to the population average.  
- **Law of small numbers** — The mistaken belief that small samples represent the population as accurately as large samples do.  
- **Mental effort** — The deliberate cognitive activity required to understand complex or counterintuitive information.  
- **Overconfidence** — The exaggerated faith in the reliability of small samples or limited information.  
- **Population** — The entire group from which samples are drawn in a statistical study.  
- **Sample size** — The number of observations or units in a sample, affecting the precision and variability of results.  
- **Sampling error** — The variation in sample results caused by the random selection of a subset from the population.  
- **Sampling luck** — The random chance influencing the representativeness of a sample, often leading to misleading conclusions.  
- **Small samples** — Samples with few observations, which tend to produce more extreme and less reliable results.  
- **Statistical regularities** — Predictable patterns observed in large collections of random events.  
- **Statistical intuition** — The natural but often flawed understanding or judgment about statistical concepts and variation.  
- **Statistical variation** — The variability inherent in samples due to chance rather than systematic causes.  
- **Statistics** — The science of collecting, analyzing, and interpreting data, especially to understand variability and reliability.  
- **System 1** — The fast, automatic, and intuitive mode of thinking prone to seeing patterns and causal links.  
- **System 2** — The slower, deliberate, and analytical mode of thinking capable of doubt and statistical reasoning.  
- **WYSIATI (What You See Is All There Is)** — The cognitive principle that people make judgments based only on the information immediately available.

- **Amygdala** — A brain region associated with emotional arousal, rapidly activated by emotional stimuli and likely involved in System 1 processing.  
- **Anterior cingulate** — A brain region linked to conflict monitoring and self-control, more active when individuals resist intuitive System 1 responses.  
- **Asian disease problem** — A classic framing example demonstrating how different descriptions of the same problem lead to risk-averse or risk-seeking choices.  
- **Behavioral economics** — The study of how psychological insights affect economic decision making, often challenging classical rational-agent models.  
- **Cognitive illusion** — A misleading perception or judgment arising from the way information is framed or presented.  
- **Emotional framing** — The influence of emotionally loaded words on preferences and beliefs, leading to different reactions to logically equivalent statements.  
- **Framing effect** — The phenomenon where different but logically equivalent descriptions of the same choice lead to different decisions or preferences.  
- **Gallons-per-mile frame** — A preferable way to express fuel efficiency that leads to more accurate assessments of fuel savings than miles-per-gallon.  
- **Keep–Lose framing** — A framing method showing that people’s preference for a sure option varies depending on whether it is described as a gain (keep) or a loss (lose).  
- **Loss aversion** — A tendency for people to prefer avoiding losses over acquiring equivalent gains, causing losses to evoke stronger negative feelings than costs.  
- **Mental accounting** — The cognitive process by which people categorize and evaluate economic outcomes by grouping them into separate mental “accounts”.  
- **Neuroeconomics** — The interdisciplinary field examining brain activity during economic decision-making to understand the neural basis of choices.  
- **Opt-in/opt-out framing** — Default settings in choices (e.g., organ donation) where participation requires either affirmative action (opt-in) or non-action (opt-out), strongly influencing behavior.  
- **Prospect theory** — A behavioral economic theory describing how people choose between probabilistic alternatives involving risk, showing risk aversion for gains and risk seeking for losses.  
- **Reality-bound preferences** — Decisions and beliefs that depend solely on the actual state of the world, independent of linguistic framing or emotional associations.  
- **Reference point** — The baseline or status quo against which gains and losses are evaluated, central to framing effects and decision outcomes.  
- **Risk aversion** — The preference for a sure outcome over a risky gamble when expected values are equal, especially in the domain of gains.  
- **Risk seeking** — The preference for a gamble over a sure loss when both outcomes are negative, often triggered by framing effects.  
- **Schelling’s framing example** — Demonstration that moral intuitions about fairness can yield contradictory answers depending on whether tax benefits or penalties are framed as exemptions or surcharges.  
- **Sunk-cost fallacy** — The tendency to consider past, unrecoverable costs in current decision-making, often leading to irrational persistence.  
- **System 1** — The fast, automatic, intuitive mode of thinking that is emotionally driven and sensitive to framing effects.  
- **System 2** — The slow, deliberate, analytical mode of thinking responsible for effortful reasoning and reframing tasks, often described as “lazy.”  
- **Truth conditions** — The conditions under which statements are true; logically equivalent statements share identical truth conditions despite different connotations.  
- **Value frame** — The perspective or lens through which a decision or statement is interpreted, influencing emotional responses and choices.  
- **Willingness to pay** — A preference measure indicating how much someone values a good or outcome, potentially affected by framing.

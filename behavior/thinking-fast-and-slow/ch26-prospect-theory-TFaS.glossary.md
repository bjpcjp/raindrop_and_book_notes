- **Adaptation level** — A neutral reference point relative to which gains and losses are evaluated.  
- **Bad choices** — Decisions involving sure losses compared to larger probable losses that often lead to risk-seeking behavior due to diminishing sensitivity.  
- **Diminishing sensitivity** — The principle that the subjective difference between quantities diminishes as their magnitude increases, applying to both gains and losses.  
- **Disappointment** — A negative emotional response when an outcome is worse than expected; not accounted for by standard prospect theory.  
- **Expected utility theory** — A traditional economic model where choices are based on the utility of final states of wealth, assuming consistent risk attitudes.  
- **Final states of wealth** — Total wealth after gains or losses, used as the basis for utility in classical economic theory.  
- **Gains** — Outcomes that are better than the reference point, typically evaluated positively in prospect theory.  
- **Indifference to risk** — A condition where an individual perceives no benefit or cost difference between risky and certain options.  
- **Investment risk seeking** — Tendency to prefer gambles over sure losses, especially when facing losses (risk seeking in the domain of losses).  
- **Loss aversion** — The phenomenon where losses are perceived as more psychologically impactful than equivalent gains.  
- **Loss aversion ratio** — A quantitative measure of loss aversion; for example, needing about twice the gain to accept a gamble with an equal chance of losing a given amount.  
- **Losses** — Outcomes worse than the reference point, evaluated more strongly than equivalent gains in prospect theory.  
- **Mixed gambles** — Choices involving simultaneous possibilities of gains and losses, often causing strong loss aversion.  
- **Monty Python ex-parrot analogy** — A humorous illustration used to emphasize that expected utility theory is an outdated and inadequate model.  
- **Perception and judgment (System 1)** — Fast, automatic, emotional cognitive processes that influence evaluations in prospect theory.  
- **Probability evaluation distortion** — Altered subjective perception of probabilities contributing to risk aversion or risk seeking in gains and losses.  
- **Prospect theory** — A descriptive model of decision making under risk that evaluates outcomes as gains or losses relative to a reference point, incorporating loss aversion and diminishing sensitivity.  
- **Reference point** — The baseline or neutral point from which gains and losses are assessed, often the status quo or an expected outcome.  
- **Regret** — A retrospective negative emotion experienced when an outcome is worse than an alternative option that was not chosen, not accounted for fully in prospect theory.  
- **Risk aversion** — Preference for sure gains over risky prospects when facing potential positive outcomes.  
- **Risk seeking** — Preference for risky prospects over sure losses, more common when facing potential negative outcomes.  
- **S-shaped value function** — The graphical representation of subjective value in prospect theory, showing concavity for gains and convexity for losses with an abrupt slope change at the reference point.  
- **States of wealth** — Absolute levels of wealth, used in classical utility theory to assign utility.  
- **Theory-induced blindness** — The failure to notice flaws in a dominant theory due to its long-standing acceptance and influence.  
- **Two-systems model** — A cognitive framework distinguishing between automatic/emotional (System 1) and deliberative/rational (System 2) thinking processes.  
- **Utility of wealth** — A concept in expected utility theory assigning value to overall wealth rather than changes in wealth.  
- **Value function** — A function describing how gains and losses are subjectively valued relative to a reference point, central to prospect theory.  
- **Winning nothing** — The neutral outcome in a gamble, considered the reference point by prospect theory but subject to emotional disappointment if expectations are high.

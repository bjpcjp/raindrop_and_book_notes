The illusion of understanding leads us to construct coherent but flawed narratives of past events, overestimating the role of skill and underestimating luck, which fosters a false sense of predictability and control over the future. This cognitive bias, compounded by hindsight and outcome biases, distorts our evaluation of decisions and success, causing us to misattribute causes and overlook the significant impact of randomness and uncertainty in complex outcomes.

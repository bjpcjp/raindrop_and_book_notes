This book explores the interplay between two systems of thinking—fast, intuitive System 1 and slow, deliberative System 2—highlighting the conflicts between the experiencing self, which lives through moments, and the remembering self, which evaluates and makes choices based on memory distortions like duration neglect and the peak-end rule. It emphasizes the limitations of human rationality compared to the idealized rational "Econs," advocating for libertarian paternalism and behavioral interventions, such as nudges, to help individuals make better decisions without compromising freedom.

System 2 operates with effort and self-control, managing complex tasks that require attention, rule-following, and deliberate choice, while System 1 handles automatic, intuitive processes. Mental effort can be measured by physiological responses like pupil dilation, which increases with task difficulty and cognitive load, reflecting the limited capacity and selective allocation of attention inherent in System 2.

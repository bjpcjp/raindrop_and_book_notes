- **Cognitive Ease** — A mental state where processing information feels easy, indicating no threats or surprises, leading to good mood, trust, and superficial thinking.  
- **Cognitive Strain** — A mental state where processing feels effortful due to challenges or unmet demands, causing vigilance, suspicion, and deeper analytic thinking.  
- **Illusions of Remembering** — The false sense of familiarity with information (e.g., names) caused by cognitive ease rather than true memory.  
- **Illusions of Truth** — The phenomenon where repeated or familiar statements are more likely to be believed true, regardless of actual accuracy.  
- **Mere Exposure Effect** — Increased liking or positive affect for a stimulus due to repeated, even unconscious, exposure.  
- **Remote Association Test (RAT)** — A creativity measure testing the ability to find a common associate for three words, linked to intuition and cognitive ease.  
- **Safety Signal** — A stimulus that becomes associated with lack of harm through repetition, leading to positive feelings and cognitive ease.  
- **System 1** — The fast, automatic, intuitive mental processing system responsible for generating impressions of familiarity, cognitive ease, and quick judgments.  
- **System 2** — The slower, effortful, analytic mental processing system that engages when cognitive strain is detected, enabling careful reasoning and vigilance.  
- **Truth Illusion** — A biased belief in truth caused by cognitive ease; familiarity with a statement increases perceived truthfulness.

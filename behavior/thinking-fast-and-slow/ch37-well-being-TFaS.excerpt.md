The study of experienced well-being focuses on measuring happiness based on moment-to-moment feelings rather than global life satisfaction, using methods like experience sampling and the Day Reconstruction Method to assess emotional states throughout daily activities. Findings reveal that income increases life satisfaction up to a point but does not enhance experienced well-being beyond a certain level, and reducing the time spent in unpleasant states (the U-index) through better social connections and activities people enjoy is key to improving happiness.

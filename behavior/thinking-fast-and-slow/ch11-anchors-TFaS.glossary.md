- **Adjustment** — A deliberate, effortful process in System 2 where estimates are anchored to a starting value and then adjusted, often insufficiently, toward a final judgment.  
- **Adjustment as Anchoring** — The heuristic of starting from an anchor and making gradual mental adjustments to estimate an unknown quantity, typically stopping prematurely.  
- **Anchoring Effect** — The cognitive bias where estimates stay close to an initially considered number (the anchor), even if it is irrelevant or random.  
- **Anchoring Index** — A numerical measure of anchoring strength calculated as the ratio of the difference in group estimates to the difference in anchor values, expressed as a percentage.  
- **Anchor** — A reference number presented before an estimation task that influences subsequent judgments.  
- **Associative Coherence** — A System 1 process where activated ideas spread activation to related concepts, producing biased judgments consistent with the anchor.  
- **Intensive Matching** — The process of finding a numerical value that matches the intensity of a feeling or preference, often influenced by anchoring.  
- **Insufficient Adjustment** — The failure to adjust estimates far enough away from an anchor due to uncertainty or limited mental effort.  
- **Priming Effect** — An automatic, unconscious activation of related concepts in memory caused by exposure to a stimulus (such as an anchor) that influences judgments.  
- **Suggestion** — A type of priming where simply bringing a concept to mind influences perceptions or reports, often without conscious awareness.  
- **System 1** — The fast, automatic, intuitive mental system that processes information unconsciously and is susceptible to priming and associative coherence.  
- **System 2** — The slow, deliberate, conscious mental system responsible for reasoning, effortful adjustment, and control of thought processes.  
- **WYSIATI (What You See Is All There Is)** — The tendency of System 1 to use only available information without considering what is missing, contributing to anchoring biases.

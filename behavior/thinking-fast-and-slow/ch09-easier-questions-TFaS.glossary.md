- **Affect Heuristic** — A mental shortcut where people’s likes and dislikes influence their beliefs about the world, often letting emotions determine judgments of risks and benefits.  
- **Cognitive Ease** — A feeling linked by System 1 to illusions of truth and pleasantness, leading to reduced vigilance and less critical thinking.  
- **Coherence Seeking** — The tendency of System 1 to create a consistent pattern by linking activated ideas in associative memory.  
- **Heuristic** — A simple procedure or mental shortcut used to find adequate, though often imperfect, answers to difficult questions.  
- **Heuristic Question** — A simpler question answered instead of the complex target question during mental substitution.  
- **Intensity Matching** — System 1’s ability to translate the intensity of one scale (e.g., feelings) into a corresponding intensity on another scale (e.g., dollars).  
- **Loss Aversion** — The tendency to respond more strongly to losses than to gains.  
- **Mental Shotgun** — The automatic process by which System 1 generates multiple possible answers or impressions rapidly and imprecisely.  
- **Mood Heuristic** — Substituting the answer to a general question about happiness with an answer related to current mood or recent emotional events.  
- **Negative Evidence Neglect (WYSIATI)** — The bias of System 1 to focus on available evidence and ignore absent or missing evidence (“What You See Is All There Is”).  
- **Prospect Theory** — A theory describing how people make decisions involving risk, highlighting sensitivity to changes rather than states and overweighting of low probabilities.  
- **Psychophysics** — The study of relationships between physical stimuli and sensations, relevant here to diminishing sensitivity to quantity.  
- **Substitution** — The automatic replacement of a difficult target question with an easier heuristic question, whose answer is then used as if it addressed the original question.  
- **System 1** — The fast, automatic, effortless mental system generating impressions, feelings, and intuitive answers, often biased but efficient.  
- **System 2** — The slow, deliberate, effortful mental system responsible for logical analysis, self-control, and overriding System 1 responses; can endorse or reject heuristics.  
- **Target Question** — The complex or difficult question that a person intends to answer.  
- **WYSIATI** — Acronym for “What You See Is All There Is,” describing System 1’s tendency to make judgments based only on the information immediately available.  
- **3-D Heuristic** — A perceptual substitution where the mind interprets two-dimensional images as three-dimensional scenes, leading to systematic illusions.

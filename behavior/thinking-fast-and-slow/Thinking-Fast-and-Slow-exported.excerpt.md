The book explores the dual-process model of the mind, distinguishing between the fast, automatic, intuitive System 1 and the slow, effortful, rational System 2, which monitors and controls thought and behavior but is often "lazy." It highlights how mental effort is limited and costly, causing people to rely on intuitive judgments that can lead to systematic biases and overconfidence, while emphasizing the importance of understanding these processes to improve decision making.

The authors examine how cognitive and psychophysical factors influence decision making under risk, highlighting that people tend to be risk averse for gains and risk seeking for losses due to an S-shaped value function and nonlinear weighting of probabilities. They demonstrate that framing effects violate the invariance principle of rational choice, showing that the way outcomes and probabilities are presented can significantly alter preferences and decisions.

The fourfold pattern in prospect theory reveals that people assign decision weights to outcomes differently from their objective probabilities, resulting in risk-averse behavior for gains with high probability, risk-seeking for gains with low probability, risk-seeking for losses with high probability, and risk-averse for losses with low probability. This pattern explains common deviations from expected utility theory, such as the possibility and certainty effects, and has practical implications for decision making in contexts like gambling, insurance, and legal settlements.

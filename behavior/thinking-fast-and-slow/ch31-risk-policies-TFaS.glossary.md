- **Broad framing** — Considering multiple decisions together as a single comprehensive choice, leading to more consistent and optimal outcomes.  
- **Deductible** — The amount paid out of pocket before an insurance policy pays a claim; choosing a high deductible is an example of a risk policy.  
- **Decision (i)** — Choice between a sure gain ($240) and a risky gamble (25% chance for $1,000, 75% chance for nothing).  
- **Decision (ii)** — Choice between a sure loss ($750) and a risky gamble (75% chance to lose $1,000, 25% chance to lose nothing).  
- **Dominance** — When one option is unequivocally better than another across all outcomes.  
- **Endowment effect** — The tendency for people to value owned items more than equivalent items not owned, reduced by broad framing.  
- **Expected value** — The weighted average of all possible outcomes of a gamble, based on their probabilities.  
- **Inside view** — Focusing on details and specifics of the current situation when making decisions, often leading to biases.  
- **Loss aversion** — The tendency to feel losses more intensely than equivalent gains, influencing risk preferences.  
- **Mental accounting** — Treating separate decisions or money flows as isolated, which may lead to inconsistent choices; related to narrow framing.  
- **Narrow framing** — Considering decisions in isolation, leading to potentially inconsistent and suboptimal choices.  
- **Outside view** — Assessing decisions by looking at statistics and outcomes of similar past situations to reduce bias.  
- **Planning fallacy** — The tendency to underestimate the time, costs, and risks of future actions, while overestimating benefits.  
- **Portfolio** — A collection of investments or gambles considered as a whole rather than individually.  
- **Preference coherence** — Logical consistency across choices, often violated due to narrow framing and emotional biases.  
- **Prospect theory** — A behavioral economic theory explaining how people decide between alternatives involving risk, highlighting loss aversion and framing effects.  
- **Risk policy** — A pre-established approach to risk-taking designed to apply routinely across decisions, acting as a broad frame.  
- **Risk seeking** — Preference for risky options when facing potential losses, often to avoid sure losses.  
- **Risk aversion** — Preference for sure outcomes over risky gambles when facing potential gains.  
- **Samuelson’s problem** — A paradox where a rational utility maximizer would reject multiple favorable bets despite favorable aggregated odds due to loss aversion and narrow framing.  
- **System 1** — The automatic, fast, emotional mode of thinking responsible for intuitive reactions like attraction to sure gains and aversion to sure losses.  
- **System 2** — The slower, deliberate, effortful mode of thinking that can compute expected values and ensure logical consistency.  
- **Value function** — A function representing how people subjectively value gains and losses, often incorporating loss aversion by weighting losses more heavily.  
- **WY SIATI** — “What You See Is All There Is,” a cognitive bias where people ignore information outside the immediate context, contributing to narrow framing.

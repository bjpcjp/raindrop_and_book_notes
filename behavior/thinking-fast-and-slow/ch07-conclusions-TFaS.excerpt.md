System 1 quickly jumps to conclusions by constructing coherent stories from limited and ambiguous information, often suppressing doubt and alternative interpretations, while System 2 is responsible for deliberate doubt and correction but is frequently lazy or preoccupied. This dynamic leads to biases such as overconfidence, confirmation bias, and framing effects, all stemming from the principle that "what you see is all there is" (WYSIATI), whereby individuals form judgments based solely on the information immediately available to them.

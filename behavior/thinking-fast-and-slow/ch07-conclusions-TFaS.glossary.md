- **Bias to Believe** — The tendency of System 1 to automatically accept statements as true initially, requiring System 2’s effort to disbelieve or doubt them.  
- **Base-rate Neglect** — Ignoring statistical information (base rates) when judging probabilities, focusing instead on salient descriptions or stories.  
- **Cognitive Ease** — The feeling of comfort and fluency when processing coherent information, which can lead to acceptance of conclusions without question.  
- **Coherence-Seeking System 1** — System 1’s drive to create a consistent and sensible story from the information currently available.  
- **Confirmation Bias** — The tendency to seek, interpret, and remember information that confirms existing beliefs rather than seeking to refute them.  
- **Decorrelate Errors** — A principle recommending independent judgments to reduce correlated biases and improve accuracy of aggregated decisions.  
- **Emotional Coherence (Halo Effect)** — The bias where liking one trait (e.g., a person’s friendliness) influences liking unrelated traits, creating an overall positive impression.  
- **Framing Effect** — The change in people’s decisions or reactions depending on how equivalent information is presented or framed.  
- **Jumping to Conclusions** — Rapid, often automatic decision-making by System 1 based on limited evidence, potentially leading to errors.  
- **Neglect of Ambiguity** — System 1’s failure to recognize ambiguous information and its tendency to resolve it prematurely without awareness of alternatives.  
- **Overconfidence** — Excessive confidence in one’s judgments, usually due to reliance on coherent but incomplete information under WYSIATI.  
- **Positive Test Strategy** — The common but flawed approach of testing hypotheses by seeking confirming evidence rather than attempting falsification.  
- **Primacy Effect** — The greater influence of information encountered first (first impressions) on overall judgment, related to the halo effect.  
- **System 1** — The fast, automatic, intuitive mental process that jumps to conclusions and seeks coherent stories from available information.  
- **System 2** — The slow, deliberate, analytical mental process responsible for doubting, questioning, and overriding System 1’s intuitive outputs.  
- **WYSIATI (What You See Is All There Is)** — System 1’s tendency to make judgments and form beliefs based solely on the information currently available, ignoring missing data.

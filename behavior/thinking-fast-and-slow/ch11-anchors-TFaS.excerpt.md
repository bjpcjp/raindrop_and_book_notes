Anchoring is a psychological phenomenon where peopleâ€™s estimates are influenced by an initial number, or anchor, even if it is random or uninformative, due to two mechanisms: deliberate adjustment by System 2 and automatic priming by System 1. This robust effect pervades judgments and decisions, often without awareness, making individuals susceptible to suggestion and bias in various real-world contexts.

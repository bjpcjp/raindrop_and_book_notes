- **Anchoring** — A cognitive bias where individuals rely heavily on an initial piece of information (the "anchor") when making decisions or estimates.  
- **Category Norms** — Reference standards retrieved by System 1 that adjust the interpretation of attributes like height or intensity based on context (e.g., age group).  
- **Coherence Doctrine** — The principle that preferences and choices should be consistent and context-independent.  
- **Emotional Reaction** — Automatic, often subconscious responses generated by System 1 that influence judgments and decisions.  
- **Intensity Matching** — The process of translating the emotional intensity of a feeling onto a different scale, such as monetary value or contribution amount.  
- **Joint Evaluation** — Simultaneously considering two or more scenarios or options to make comparative judgments, engaging System 2 for more deliberate thinking.  
- **Mock Jurors** — Participants in legal experiments who simulate jury decision-making to study patterns of judgment.  
- **Norms** — Standards or typical values in a category against which individuals or objects are compared.  
- **Preference Reversal** — A phenomenon in which individuals change their preferences between options depending on whether choices are evaluated separately or jointly.  
- **Public-Health Issue** — A category evoked during evaluation that frames a problem as affecting human health broadly.  
- **Regret (Poignancy)** — A counterfactual emotion arising from imagining how outcomes could have been better under different circumstances.  
- **Salience** — The degree to which a feature or aspect of a situation stands out and captures attention in decision-making.  
- **Single Evaluation** — Assessing one option or scenario in isolation, often relying on System 1 and emotional intuition.  
- **System 1** — The fast, automatic, emotional, and intuitive thinking process that governs quick judgments and feelings.  
- **System 2** — The slow, effortful, deliberative, and logical thinking process that is engaged during complex analysis and comparisons.  
- **Substitution** — A cognitive mechanism where a difficult question is replaced by an easier one without conscious awareness.  
- **Within-Subject Experiment** — An experimental design in which the same participant evaluates multiple conditions or options, allowing for direct comparisons.  
- **WYSIATI (What You See Is All There Is)** — A cognitive bias where individuals base decisions on the information immediately available, ignoring possible alternatives.

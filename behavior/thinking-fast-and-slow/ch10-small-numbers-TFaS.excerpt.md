The Law of Small Numbers describes the common cognitive error of overinterpreting results from small samples, leading to mistaken causal conclusions about random variations that are actually artifacts of sampling size. This bias causes people, including researchers, to underestimate the variability inherent in small samples and overestimate the reliability and coherence of observed patterns.

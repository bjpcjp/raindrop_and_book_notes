- **Actuarial criterion** — Evaluation of options based on objective, statistical consequences rather than psychological impacts.  
- **Adaptation level** — The hedonic reference point separating positive from negative outcomes, influenced by expectations and social comparisons.  
- **Advantages** — Positive aspects or benefits of an option relative to a reference state in mental accounting.  
- **Allais paradox** — A violation of expected utility theory occurring when people's choices contradict the substitution axiom.  
- **Concave function (utility/value)** — A function where increases in gains yield diminishing subjective value increments, explaining risk aversion in gains.  
- **Cost-loss discrepancy** — The phenomenon where the same amount framed as a cost or as a loss leads to different preferences due to loss aversion.  
- **Decision value** — The contribution of an anticipated outcome to the attractiveness or aversiveness of an option in a choice.  
- **Decision weight** — Subjective weighting assigned to the probability of an outcome, often nonlinear and differing from objective probability.  
- **Dominance principle** — The rational choice axiom that if one prospect is better than another in all respects, it should be preferred.  
- **Endowment effect** — The tendency for people to value owned assets more highly than equivalent assets not owned, due to loss aversion.  
- **Experience value** — The actual hedonic pleasure or pain experienced from an outcome.  
- **Framing effect** — Changes in preferences caused by describing equivalent options differently, violating invariance.  
- **Hedonic adaptation** — The process by which people become accustomed to changes, reducing the long-term emotional impact of gains or losses.  
- **Invariance principle** — The normative requirement that preferences should remain consistent regardless of how choices are described or framed.  
- **Loss aversion** — The tendency for losses to loom larger than gains of the same magnitude, leading to stronger emotional impact.  
- **Mental accounting** — The process of organizing and evaluating outcomes of transactions in separate mental budgets or accounts.  
- **Normative analysis** — The study of how decisions should be made according to principles of rationality and logic.  
- **Perceptual illusion (in decision making)** — Systematic preference reversals caused by framing effects, resembling a cognitive illusion.  
- **Positive domain** — The range of outcomes involving gains relative to a reference point.  
- **Prescriptive considerations** — Recommendations or guidelines on how decisions ought to be made.  
- **Probabilistic insurance** — Protective actions that reduce but do not eliminate risk, often undervalued due to nonlinear probability weighting.  
- **Prospect (decision context)** — A gamble or choice with multiple possible outcomes and associated probabilities.  
- **Prospect theory** — A descriptive model positing an S-shaped value function defined over gains and losses with loss aversion and nonlinear probability weighting.  
- **Pseudo-certainty effect** — The tendency to overweight outcomes perceived as certain despite being uncertain in multi-stage decision problems.  
- **Reference point** — The baseline or status quo against which gains and losses are evaluated.  
- **Regret and envy** — Secondary emotional consequences influencing the evaluation of outcomes and decisions.  
- **Risk aversion** — Preference for a sure outcome over a gamble with higher or equal expected value, typical in gains domain.  
- **Risk seeking** — Preference for a gamble over a sure outcome with equal or lower expected value, common in losses domain.  
- **Status quo bias** — The preference for maintaining the current state due to loss aversion and reference dependence.  
- **Substitution axiom** — A rationality principle stating preferences between prospects should hold when mixed with a common third option.  
- **Transitivity (preference axiom)** — The principle that if A is preferred to B and B to C, then A should be preferred to C.  
- **Value function** — A function mapping gains and losses to subjective values, typically concave for gains, convex for losses, and steeper for losses.  
- **Weighting function** — A nonlinear function describing how objective probabilities are transformed into decision weights.

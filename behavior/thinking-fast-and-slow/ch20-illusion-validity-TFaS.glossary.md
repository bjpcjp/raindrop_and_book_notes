- **Confidence by coherence** — The subjective confidence we have in our opinions, reflecting the coherence of the story constructed by System 1 and System 2, rather than the amount or quality of evidence.  
- **Cognitive ease** — The mental comfort or fluency experienced when processing coherent information, which influences subjective confidence.  
- **Foxes** — Complex thinkers who recognize reality emerges from many interacting agents and forces, including luck, and score better at prediction but are less invited to media.  
- **Hedgehogs** — Opinionated experts who believe in one big theory explaining the world, are confident in their forecasts, and reluctant to admit error.  
- **Illusion of validity** — The mistaken confidence in the predictability of outcomes based on coherent but insufficient evidence.  
- **Illusion of skill** — The false belief that one can consistently outperform others or the market, despite evidence showing outcomes are largely due to chance.  
- **Investment advisers** — Financial professionals providing stock selection advice, often unaware their apparent skill is largely luck-driven.  
- **Leaderless group challenge** — A military test evaluating leadership and cooperation by solving a physical obstacle problem without assigned leaders.  
- **Müller-Lyer illusion** — A visual illusion where lines appear unequal though they are equal, used as a metaphor for cognitive illusions like false confidence.  
- **Nonregressive predictions** — Forecasts that do not moderate or regress toward the mean despite weak evidence, leading to overconfident and often inaccurate outcomes.  
- **System 1** — The fast, automatic, and intuitive mode of thinking prone to jumping to conclusions based on limited evidence.  
- **System 2** — The slow, deliberate, and analytical mode of thinking that supervises System 1 but is often bypassed.  
- **Subjective confidence** — The feeling of certainty in a judgment, driven by coherence and ease of processing rather than objective accuracy.  
- **Substitution** — A cognitive shortcut where a difficult question is replaced with an easier one, often leading to biased judgments.  
- **Tetlock’s expert study** — A twenty-year analysis showing experts make poorer predictions than chance and tend to be overconfident and resistant to admitting errors.  
- **WYSIATI (What You See Is All There Is)** — The tendency to make judgments based only on the evidence at hand, ignoring missing information or uncertainty.  
- **Year-to-year correlation of skill** — A measure of consistency in performance; near-zero correlation indicates results are due to luck rather than skill.

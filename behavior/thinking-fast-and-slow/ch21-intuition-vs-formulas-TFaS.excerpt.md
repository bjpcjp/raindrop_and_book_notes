Paul Meehlâ€™s research demonstrated that simple statistical algorithms consistently outperform expert clinical judgments in predicting outcomes across diverse fields, highlighting the superiority of formula-based decisions over human intuition in low-validity environments. Despite initial hostility rooted in an illusion of skill and moral preference for human judgment, evidence supports using standardized, objective scoring methods combined with minimal intuitive input to improve predictive accuracy.

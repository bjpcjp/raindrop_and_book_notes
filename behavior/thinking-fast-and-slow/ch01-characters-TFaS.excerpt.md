The mind operates through two interacting systems: System 1, which functions automatically and effortlessly, generating impressions and intuitions, and System 2, which engages in deliberate, effortful mental activities requiring attention and self-control. While System 1 handles routine tasks and quick judgments, System 2 oversees complex reasoning and error correction, although it is slower and limited in capacity, often relying on System 1â€™s suggestions.

Bernoulli’s theory of expected utility, which posits that people evaluate gambles based on the psychological utility of wealth rather than expected monetary value, successfully explains risk aversion through diminishing marginal utility but fails to account for reference dependence and the varying impact of recent changes in wealth on subjective happiness.

Life satisfaction and happiness judgments are strongly influenced by cognitive heuristics like the focusing illusion, which causes people to overemphasize salient aspects of their lives—such as recent marriage or climate—while neglecting less obvious but more constant factors and the role of time and adaptation. Consequently, individuals often misjudge their well-being and make errors in affective forecasting, revealing the complexity of measuring and understanding well-being beyond momentary feelings or global life evaluations.

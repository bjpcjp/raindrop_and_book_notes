- **Correlation coefficient** — A measure ranging from 0 to 1 that indicates the strength and direction of a linear relationship between two variables.  
- **Causal explanation** — An interpretation that assigns a cause to a particular event or outcome.  
- **Control group** — A group in an experiment that does not receive the treatment, used as a baseline to measure the treatment's effect.  
- **Extreme group** — A subset of individuals selected for being significantly above or below average on a variable.  
- **Filial regression** — The tendency for offspring to exhibit traits closer to the population average than their parents, observed by Galton.  
- **Imperfect correlation** — A situation where the correlation between two variables is less than 1, indicating that they do not share all influencing factors.  
- **Luck** — Random factors contributing to variability in performance or outcomes that are not due to skill or talent.  
- **Mediocrity** — The average or mean level of a given characteristic or performance in a population.  
- **Prediction regression** — The process of adjusting predictions toward the mean when anticipating future performance based on past data.  
- **Regression effect** — The statistical tendency for extreme observations to be followed by less extreme ones in subsequent measurements.  
- **Regression to the mean** — The phenomenon where unusually high or low measurements tend to be followed by measurements closer to the average on subsequent trials.  
- **Sample ranking** — Ordering individuals or items in a group based on their performance or characteristics from highest to lowest.  
- **Shared factors** — Influences or variables that affect two measures simultaneously, contributing to their correlation.  
- **Skill training principle** — The idea that rewarding improved performance is generally more effective than punishing mistakes.  
- **Statistical regularity** — A predictable pattern or relationship that emerges from the analysis of data across multiple observations.  
- **System 1** — The fast, automatic, intuitive mode of thinking prone to seeking causal explanations.  
- **System 2** — The slower, analytical, deliberate mode of thinking responsible for understanding statistical and abstract concepts.  
- **Talent** — A person’s inherent ability or aptitude contributing to success.  
- **Variables measured on different scales** — Variables that assess different attributes and cannot be directly compared without standardization.  
- **Variation due to chance** — The random fluctuations in measurements or performance not explained by stable traits or conditions.  
- **Weighted shared influence** — The proportional contribution of shared factors to the correlation between variables.

The availability heuristic describes how people estimate the frequency of events based on the ease with which instances come to mind, often leading to systematic biases influenced by salience, vividness, or personal experience. Research shows that judgments are dominated not by the number of examples recalled but by the fluency of retrieval, which can be modified by awareness or engagement of deliberate reasoning, illustrating the interplay between intuitive and reflective cognitive processes.

Rare events are often overestimated and overweighted in decision making due to vividness, emotional arousal, and the format in which probabilities are presented, leading to disproportionate fear or hope that is insensitive to actual probability levels. This bias arises from the automatic, associative processes of System 1, which generate salient images and feelings that outweigh rational assessments, especially when events are described concretely or evoke strong mental imagery.

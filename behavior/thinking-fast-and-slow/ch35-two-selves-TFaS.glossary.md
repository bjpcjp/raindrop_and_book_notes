- **Decision utility** — The kind of utility economists use to mean “wantability,” reflecting the preferences people express when making decisions, often governed by rational choice rules, and not necessarily aligned with actual hedonic experiences.  
- **Duration neglect** — The tendency for retrospective evaluations of an experience to ignore its duration, focusing instead on specific moments like the peak and the end.  
- **Experienced utility** — Utility defined as the hedonic experience of pleasure or pain in the moment, as originally conceived by Bentham, measurable over time as the actual sensations felt.  
- **Hedonimeter** — A hypothetical instrument proposed by Francis Edgeworth to measure moment-by-moment pleasure or pain, allowing experienced utility to be plotted as a function of time and summed as the area under the curve.  
- **Peak-end rule** — A psychological principle that global retrospective evaluations of an experience are strongly influenced by the intensity of the peak (worst or best moment) and the end of the experience, rather than the total or average level.  
- **Remembering self** — The self that recalls past experiences and forms memories, influencing future decisions based on those memories rather than on the actual moment-to-moment experience.  
- **Rational agent model** — An economic model that assumes individuals have consistent preferences, fully know their tastes (present and future), and make decisions to maximize their interests, typically relying on decision utility.  
- **System 1** — The intuitive, automatic, and fast cognitive system that stores memories as averages or prototypes and influences preferences, often relying on heuristics like peaks and ends rather than totals.  
- **Two selves** — The concept distinguishing the experiencing self, who feels moment-to-moment sensations, from the remembering self, who recollects and judges experiences based on memory, often leading to conflicts in assessing utility.

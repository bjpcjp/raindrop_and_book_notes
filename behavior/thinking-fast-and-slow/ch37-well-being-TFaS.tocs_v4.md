- **Introduction to Well-Being and Remembering Self**
  - The global life satisfaction question targets the remembering self, assessing overall life judgments.
  - The remembering self is shown to be an error-prone witness to actual experiential well-being.
  - The experiencing self focuses on ongoing engagement, time spent in enjoyable activities, and minimal neutral states.
  - Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi’s concept of flow exemplifies deeply engaging and enjoyable experiences.

- **Measuring Experienced Well-Being**
  - Continuous recording of experience is impractical; experience sampling via smartphone notifications was developed.
  - The Day Reconstruction Method (DRM) approximates experience sampling by reconstructing detailed episodes from the previous day.
  - Participants rate feelings on scales and identify activities and social context during each episode.
  - DRM enables duration-weighted measures of affect, correlating experience sampling with reliable retrieval of emotions.

- **Emotional States and the U-Index**
  - Positive and negative emotions coexist, but episodes are classified as pleasant or unpleasant based on comparative ratings.
  - The U-index measures the percentage of time spent in unpleasant emotional states.
  - American women spent about 19% of waking time in unpleasant states, higher than French (16%) and Danish women (14%).
  - A minority experiences most emotional distress; half reported entire days free of unpleasant episodes.

- **U-Index by Activities and Temporal Patterns**
  - Activity-specific U-index values reveal higher unpleasantness during commuting, work, and childcare.
  - Weekdays show higher U-indices than weekends due to less disliked activities and work stress on weekends.
  - American women found time with children less enjoyable than housework; French women spend less time but enjoy it more.
  - Cultural and structural factors (e.g., child care availability) influence experienced well-being by activity.

- **Situational Influences on Momentary Mood**
  - Current mood depends more on immediate situation than global factors like job satisfaction.
  - Positive influences include socializing with coworkers; negative factors include loud noise, time pressure, and presence of a boss.
  - Attention concentration on the current activity strongly affects emotional experience.
  - Multitasking dilutes pleasure, as shown by differences between American and French women’s eating experiences.

- **Implications for Individuals and Society**
  - Individuals may improve well-being by reorganizing time to reduce commuting and increase enjoyable activities.
  - Social policies enhancing transportation, child care, and social opportunities can efficiently lower societal U-index.
  - National surveys combining time use and experienced well-being can inform effective policy design.
  - Alan Krueger contributed to incorporating experienced well-being measures into national statistics.

- **National and Global Surveys of Experienced Well-Being**
  - Large-scale surveys in the U.S., Canada, Europe, and the Gallup World Poll now routinely measure experienced emotions.
  - Quality of daily experience strongly influenced by health and social contacts with friends and relatives.
  - Happiness is fundamentally linked to spending time with loved ones.
  - Fine-grained analyses confirm situational factors as primary determinants of moment-to-moment well-being.

- **Comparing Experienced Well-Being and Life Evaluation**
  - The Gallup Cantril Self-Anchoring Striving Scale measures evaluative life satisfaction separate from momentary experience.
  - Education raises life evaluation but not experienced well-being; it may increase stress.
  - Ill health strongly reduces experienced well-being more than life evaluation.
  - Parenthood increases daily stress and anger but has lesser impact on life satisfaction.
  - Religious participation reduces stress and increases positive affect but does not lessen depression or worry.

- **Income and Happiness**
  - Severe poverty drastically worsens experienced well-being and magnifies stress from illness, divorce, and loneliness.
  - Income beyond approximately $75,000 annually shows no increase in experienced well-being, despite enabling more pleasures.
  - Higher income correlates with higher life satisfaction but may reduce sensitivity to everyday pleasures.
  - Experimental evidence suggests that priming thoughts of wealth reduces pleasure from small experiences.
  - The distinction underscores differences between evaluative life judgments and actual lived experience.

- **Policy and Practical Recommendations on Experienced Well-Being**
  - Policy should prioritize reducing human suffering by lowering society’s U-index.
  - Depression and extreme poverty are key targets to reduce emotional distress.
  - Individuals can increase happiness by controlling time use to focus on enjoyable activities.
  - Increasing income beyond satiation level buys more pleasurable experiences but diminishes enjoyment of simple pleasures.

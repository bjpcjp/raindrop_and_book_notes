- **Base rate** — The proportion or frequency of a particular category or event within a larger population, used as prior information in probability judgments.  
- **Bayesian statistics** — A statistical approach that specifies how prior beliefs (base rates) should be updated based on new evidence, using Bayes’s rule.  
- **Bayes’s rule** — A mathematical formula describing how to update the probability of a hypothesis by combining prior probability (base rate) with the diagnosticity of new evidence.  
- **Diagnosticity** — The degree to which evidence favors one hypothesis over alternatives; how informative or indicative the evidence is.  
- **Representativeness heuristic** — A mental shortcut where people judge the probability of an event by how much it resembles a typical case, often neglecting base rates and evidence quality.  
- **Similarity judgment** — An assessment of how closely a particular instance matches a stereotype or typical example of a category.  
- **System 1** — The fast, automatic, intuitive, and associative mode of thinking responsible for generating impressions and representativeness judgments.  
- **System 2** — The slow, effortful, analytical, and deliberative mode of thinking responsible for complex reasoning and applying logical rules like probabilities.  
- **WYSIATI (What You See Is All There Is)** — A cognitive rule of System 1 causing people to base decisions solely on the information available, ignoring what might be missing.  
- **Base-rate neglect** — The cognitive error of ignoring or underweighting base rates when making probability judgments, usually due to reliance on representativeness.  
- **Cognitive fluency** — The ease with which information is processed, which can influence reliance on intuition or deliberation in judgment.  
- **Diagnostic evidence** — Information that meaningfully differentiates between hypotheses and thus should be weighted in probability assessments.  
- **Intuition** — Immediate, automatic judgments or feelings generated by System 1 without conscious reasoning.  
- **Judgment of probability** — An estimate of how likely an event or hypothesis is true, ideally constrained by logic and probability theory.  
- **Laziness (of System 2)** — A tendency for deliberative thinking to be underused, leading to reliance on intuitive but sometimes incorrect judgments.  
- **Prediction by representativeness** — An approach to forecasting outcomes based primarily on how closely an individual case matches a stereotype, often at the expense of statistical logic.  
- **Prior belief** — The initial probability assigned to an event or hypothesis before considering new evidence, often equated with base rates.  
- **Stereotype** — A widely held but simplified and generalized belief about the characteristics typical of members of a particular group.  
- **Subjective degree of belief** — An individual’s personal estimation of the likelihood of an event, reflecting uncertainty rather than frequency-based probability.  
- **System 1 error** — Mistakes arising from automatic intuitive processes such as ignoring base rates or evidence quality.  
- **System 2 failure** — Errors due to either ignorance or insufficient effort to engage in analytical reasoning, allowing System 1 errors to go unchecked.  
- **Bayesian reasoning** — The disciplined process of updating probabilities based on combining prior beliefs with the strength and relevance of new evidence.  
- **Predictive accuracy** — The correctness of forecasting an outcome, improved by applying base rates and properly weighting evidence.

Regression to the mean explains that extreme performances or measurements tend to be followed by more average ones due to random fluctuations and imperfect correlation, rather than causal effects from interventions like reward or punishment. Misinterpreting this statistical phenomenon often leads to incorrect causal conclusions, underscoring the importance of recognizing that regression lacks a causal explanation despite its frequent occurrence in various contexts.

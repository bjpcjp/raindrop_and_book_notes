- **Algorithm** — A fixed, mechanical rule or formula used to make predictions or decisions based on input data.  
- **Apgar test** — A simple scoring system developed to assess the health of newborn infants, rating heart rate, respiration, reflex, muscle tone, and color on a scale of 0 to 2.  
- **Clinical prediction** — Forecasts made by trained professionals based on subjective impressions and expertise.  
- **Complexity** — The inclusion of multiple, often interacting factors or features in prediction or decision-making.  
- **Consistency** — The reliability of producing the same judgment or decision when evaluating the same information multiple times.  
- **Expert judgment** — Decisions or predictions made by human specialists relying on experience and intuition.  
- **Halo effect** — The cognitive bias where an overall impression influences separate evaluations of different traits or attributes.  
- **Interview procedure** — A systematic approach for collecting information about candidates or subjects, often involving structured questions and scoring.  
- **Low-validity environment** — A context characterized by high uncertainty and unpredictability, where prediction accuracy is generally poor.  
- **Multiple regression** — A statistical technique that assigns weights to predictors to create an optimal formula for forecasting outcomes.  
- **Prediction formula** — A mathematical rule that combines scores or ratings of variables to generate a forecast.  
- **Predictive validity** — The degree to which a method or formula accurately forecasts future outcomes.  
- **Robyn Dawes** — A researcher who demonstrated that simple equal-weight formulas often perform as well or better than complex regression models.  
- **Sample accident** — Random variations in a specific data set that may distort the optimal weights in statistical models.  
- **Score** — A numerical value assigned to a trait or feature for use in predictions or assessments.  
- **Simple weighting** — Combining predictors by giving them equal importance in a formula rather than using complex weighting schemes.  
- **Statistical prediction** — Forecasting outcomes through algorithmic combination of specific, quantifiable variables.  
- **Statistical superiority** — The finding that prediction formulas generally outperform expert clinical judgments in accuracy.  
- **System 1** — The intuitive, automatic, and context-dependent mode of thinking prone to inconsistencies and biases.  
- **Unreliable judgments** — Evaluations that vary when repeated under similar conditions, reducing their predictive power.  
- **Validity** — The extent to which a test or prediction method measures or forecasts what it is intended to.  
- **Wine price prediction** — Forecasting the future value of Bordeaux wines based on weather variables influencing grape quality.  
- **“Broken-leg rule”** — A principle stating that a formula can be overridden only in rare, decisive circumstances (e.g., a broken leg affecting behavior).

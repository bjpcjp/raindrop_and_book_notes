In *The Wisdom of Psychopaths*, Kevin Dutton explores the complex nature of psychopathy, revealing that traits traditionally seen as negative, such as fearlessness, charm, and emotional detachment, can provide significant advantages in high-pressure environments and leadership roles. The book challenges conventional views by highlighting the existence of "functional psychopaths" who use these dark traits to thrive and succeed in modern society.

      - Sincere confessions can be used as ruses to draw out others' confessions.
      - Testing loyalty through traps reveals character and predicts future actions.

    - Reliable intelligence shapes a brilliant sovereign and general’s success.

    - Information gathering must be balanced with protecting oneself from being spied upon.
    - Disinformation works as a weapon by planting false information to mislead enemies.

Maintaining independence by refusing to commit to any person, group, or cause allows one to wield power by remaining desirable and in control, as exemplified by leaders like Queen Elizabeth I and Isabella d’Este. By staying neutral amid conflicts and playing competing parties against each other, one preserves autonomy, maximizes influence, and avoids being consumed by others’ rivalries or obligations.

The Thirty-Six Strategies is a collection of ancient Chinese proverbs detailing cunning and subtle war tactics primarily applicable to politics, diplomacy, and espionage rather than direct battlefield engagement. Illustrated through historical anecdotes from various Chinese dynasties and complemented by folk tales, the strategies emphasize deception, psychological warfare, and the importance of timing and surprise in overcoming opponents.

- **Judgment**
  - **Recognizing Different Types of People**

  - **The Arrogant and Proud Man**
    - This man resents slights intensely and seeks overwhelming violent revenge regardless of context.  
    - His pride is overactive and oversensitive, making negotiation dangerous if insulted.  
    - Example: Lope de Aguirre’s relentless revenge killing an official who ordered his punishment.  
  - **The Hopelessly Insecure Man**
    - Related to the proud type but less violent and more subtle in retaliation through prolonged small attacks.  
    - Injuring him requires withdrawal to avoid gradual damage over time.  
    - Testing their reaction to mild jokes can reveal this type.  
  - **Mr. Suspicion**
    - Highly distrustful, he suspects everyone of ill intent and is often unbalanced.  
    - He is the easiest to deceive but dangerous if suspicion turns on you.  
  - **The Serpent with a Long Memory**
    - Does not display overt anger but plans cold, calculating revenge when the opportunity arises.  
    - Recognized by his cold, unaffectionate demeanor and shrewdness.  
    - If injured, must be crushed or removed to avoid future retribution.  
  - **The Plain, Unassuming, and Often Unintelligent Man**
    - Difficult to deceive due to literal-mindedness and lack of imagination.  
    - Often wastes con artists’ time rather than exacting revenge.  
    - Testing with jokes or stories reveals this type.  

- **Transgressions of the Law**
  - **Transgression I: Muhammad of Khwarezm vs. Genghis Khan**
    - Muhammad insulted and rejected Genghis Khan’s offers and ambassadors, leading to a brutal war.  
    - Khan’s novel military tactics defeated a much larger army, destroying Muhammad’s empire.  
    - Lesson: Never underestimate or insult the potentially powerful, as offense can trigger overwhelming retaliation.

  - **Transgression II: Joe Furey Con-Artist Ring and J. Frank Norfleet**
    - Norfleet was conned out of $45,000 but pursued the con artists relentlessly for five years.  
    - Unlike typical victims, Norfleet’s insecurity and refusal-to-accept defeat led to the ring’s destruction.  
    - Mark insecurity is a prime danger indicator, tested by gauging their reaction to minor insults.

  - **Transgression III: Prince Ch’ung-erh and the Ruler of Cheng**
    - The ruler’s repeated insults to the exiled prince led to devastating destruction once the prince regained power.  
    - The prince exemplifies the “serpent with a long memory.”  
    - Always avoid insulting seemingly weak or insignificant people to prevent future calamities.

  - **Transgression IV: Joseph Duveen and Henry Ford**
    - Duveen misjudged Ford as a wealthy art buyer but Ford valued the reproductions over originals and declined to purchase.  
    - Ford’s plain, literal-minded personality made him an unprofitable mark.  
    - Duveen thereafter focused only on sophisticated buyers with imagination and craftiness.

- **Keys to Power**
  - **Importance of Measuring People**
    - Success requires concrete knowledge of one’s mark; instincts alone are inadequate.  
    - Understanding weaknesses, pride, and insecurities before taking action prevents costly mistakes.  
    - Never trust appearances or self-presentations, which are often deceptive.  
  - **Cautions in Judging Opponents**
    - Extensive study and spying are necessary before engaging an opponent.  
    - Appearances can mask true character: kindness can hide cruelty; bluster can hide cowardice.  
    - Disabled contempt as it breeds permanent enmity regardless of subsequent forgiveness.  
  - **Final Reminder**
    - Know your prey thoroughly and deploy tactics suited to their type, as a hunter does.  
    - Warning: No reversal exists for ignorance about others; failing this law invites ruin.

  - **The Waning of the Middle Ages: Symbolism**
    - Symbolism acts as a shortcut of thought, linking ideas through signification instead of causal connection.  
    - Objects and images can embody multiple symbolic meanings and elevate mundane things to the sublime.  
    - The walnut and roses exemplify how physical things symbolize complex spiritual or abstract ideas.

  - **Keys to Power**
    - Words are risky and invite reflection, argument, or opposition, whereas images deliver immediate emotional impact and discourage doubt.  
    - Visual symbols can unify, communicate complex ideas instantly, and create powerful emotional associations transcending social divisions.  
    - Color, arrangement, and symbolic fusion amplify the impact of images and build compelling mythology around a person or cause.  
    - Leaders use positioning and visual sequence to assert authority, as exemplified by de Gaulle’s appearance during Paris liberation.

  - **Authority**
    - People are captivated by superficial appearances, making festivals and spectacles useful tools for occupying and distracting populations.  
    - Machiavelli advised rulers to use spectacles strategically to maintain power and public interest.

  - **Reversal**
    - Ignoring the power of images and symbols forecloses the possibility of gaining influence via spectacle.  
    - No reversal to this law is possible because visual symbolism is an essential instrument of power.

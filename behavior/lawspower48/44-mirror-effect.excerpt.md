The Mirror Effect is a powerful strategy of reflecting an opponent’s actions, desires, or behaviors back at them to unsettle, deceive, or seduce, thereby gaining psychological leverage and control. This technique operates through various forms—neutralizing, narcissistic, moral, hallucinatory, and courtier’s mirrors—and has been effectively employed in politics, warfare, social influence, and psychology, though it carries the risk of being trapped in damaging mirrored situations.

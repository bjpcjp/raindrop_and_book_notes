- **Judgment**

- **Observance of the Law**
  - Tommaso Campanella suffered persecution for heretical beliefs during the Italian Counter-Reformation.
  - He survived by feigning madness, writing a false-conformist book, and subtly insinuating true ideas.
  - Public conformity combined with private dissent allows survival and influence under persecution.
  - Campanella’s work, “Atheism Conquered,” became a covert manifesto for heretics.
  - For context, see historical works on the Inquisition and the Roman Catholic Counter-Reformation.

- **Interpretation (on Campanella)**
  - Strategic disguise and irony protect dissidents from overt persecution.
  - Conformity in appearance preserves life and allows covert expression of true beliefs.
  - Martyrdom is ineffective compared to surviving and influencing subtly.

- **Keys to Power**
  - Society enforces masks and concealment of true thoughts from an early age.

  - Study political satire and literature for parallels, e.g., Brecht’s works.

- **Reversal**
  - Displaying difference is only safe and effective once one attains unassailable power.
  - Extreme eccentricity without popularity risks overthrow or destruction (e.g., Caligula).
  - Even powerful figures often maintain or simulate common touch for political support.

- **Keys to Power**
  - **Fantasy requires the contrast of oppressive reality**
    - Fantasy thrives when reality is harsh, slow-changing, and burdensome.  
    - Identifying oppressive realities allows one to craft fantasies that appeal to masses.  
    - Examples of reality vs. fantasy: gradual change vs. sudden transformation; social limits vs. new adventures; societal conflict vs. spiritual unity; death vs. revival.  
    - The examples include historical figures like Leonhard Thurneisser, George Psalmanazar, Mata Hari, and Oscar Hartzell applying these fantasies.  
    - Fantasy must maintain distance and vagueness to preserve its allure.  
  - **Authority and the palatability of lies over truth**
    - Lies can be embellished into appealing fantasies, while truth is often uncomfortable.  
    - Joseph Weil’s quote explains how romance and lies produce greater influence and profit than truth.  
  - **Reversal**
    - There is risk in fantasy if audiences demand tangible results and the fantasy provider fails.  
    - Bragadino’s downfall in Munich illustrates the danger of overpromising and underdelivering.  
    - Fantasy may also reflect theatrical realities, as seen in figures like Abraham Lincoln and P. T. Barnum who cultivated approachable yet distant personas.  
    - Maintaining some distance and mystery is essential for sustaining power through fantasy.

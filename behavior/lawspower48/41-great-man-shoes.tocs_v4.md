- **Reversal**  
  - Using a predecessor’s shadow tactically can jumpstart power but must be discarded afterward (Napoleon III).  
  - Selective appropriation of predecessor’s qualities can strengthen authority if logically integrated.  
  - Failure to differentiate effectively can appear childish and weaken credibility.  
  - Mediocre successors should learn from predecessors rather than rebel ineffectively (Joseph II vs. Maria Theresa).  
  - Vigilance is needed as one can become the father figure to future rivals seeking to displace them.  
  - Psychological control of potential rivals, as Bernini did with Borromini and Algardi, preserves dominance.

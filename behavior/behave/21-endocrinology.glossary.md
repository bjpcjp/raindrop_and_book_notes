- **ACTH (adrenocorticotropic hormone)** — A pituitary hormone that stimulates the adrenal glands to secrete glucocorticoids during stress.  
- **Avidity** — The strength or snugness of the hormone-receptor binding, which can change to increase or decrease hormone effects.  
- **CRH (corticotropin-releasing hormone)** — A hormone secreted by hypothalamic neurons that stimulates the pituitary to release ACTH.  
- **Endocrinology** — The study of hormones and their effects on the body.  
- **Glucocorticoids** — Steroid stress hormones secreted by the adrenal glands, with cortisol as the human form.  
- **Hormone** — A chemical messenger secreted by glands into the bloodstream to affect target cells throughout the body that possess specific receptors.  
- **Hormone receptors** — Distinctive molecules on target cells that bind hormones with specificity, enabling cells to respond to hormonal signals.  
- **Hypothalamus** — A brain region that regulates autonomic functions and secretes releasing hormones controlling pituitary hormone release.  
- **Hypothalamic/pituitary/peripheral gland axis** — A hierarchical hormonal pathway where the hypothalamus releases hormones stimulating the pituitary, which then triggers hormone secretion from peripheral glands.  
- **Luteal phase** — A phase in the menstrual cycle during which progesterone causes uterine cell proliferation and thickening.  
- **Neuroendocrine axis** — A system linking the nervous system and endocrine system, where neural signals control hormone release.  
- **Neurotransmitters** — Chemical messengers released at synapses that influence nearby neurons’ excitability almost instantaneously.  
- **Organizational effects** — Permanent developmental hormone effects that shape brain structure during fetal and childhood stages.  
- **Peripheral glands** — Endocrine glands outside the brain and pituitary that produce hormones in response to pituitary signals.  
- **Pituitary gland** — An endocrine gland beneath the brain that secretes hormones regulating peripheral glands and body functions.  
- **Progesterone** — A steroid hormone that promotes uterine cell proliferation during the luteal phase.  
- **Receptor levels** — The quantity of hormone receptors in a target cell, determining the cell’s sensitivity to hormones.  
- **Steroid hormones** — Hormones derived from cholesterol, including cortisol, estrogen, progesterone, and testosterone.  
- **Stress hormones** — Hormones released in response to stress, such as glucocorticoids, that can affect immune cells.  
- **Target cells** — Cells containing specific receptors for a hormone and thus responsive to its effects.  
- **Testosterone** — A steroid hormone that increases muscle mass and influences various bodily functions.  
- **Thyroid hormone** — A hormone that regulates metabolism and can induce cell death, such as in tadpole tail cells during metamorphosis.  
- **Transitory hormonal effects (Activational effects)** — Hormonal influences lasting hours to days, modifying cell activity temporarily.  
- **Trophic hormone** — A pituitary hormone that stimulates another gland to secrete its hormone (e.g., ACTH stimulating adrenal glucocorticoids).  
- **Zones of hormone receptor expression** — Specific tissues or cell types where hormone receptors are present, determining hormone action specificity.

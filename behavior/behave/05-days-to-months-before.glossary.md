- **Adult neurogenesis** — The process of generating new neurons in the adult brain, notably in the hippocampus, contributing to learning and memory.  
- **Amygdala** — A brain region involved in fear conditioning, emotional responses, and stress-related plasticity.  
- **Axon hillock** — The part of a neuron where action potentials are initiated.  
- **Axonal plasticity** — The ability of axons to sprout new branches, change their projection targets, and remap neural circuits.  
- **BDNF (Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor)** — A key growth factor that promotes neuron survival, dendritic growth, and synaptic plasticity.  
- **Calcium signaling** — The influx of calcium through NMDA receptors triggering synaptic changes during long-term potentiation.  
- **Cortical map** — The representation of sensory or motor information in the brain’s cortex that can expand or contract with experience.  
- **Dendritic arbor** — The branching structure of a neuron's dendrites, which can grow or retract to modify synaptic connectivity.  
- **Dendritic spine** — Small protrusions on dendrites where synapses form, key sites of excitatory neurotransmission and plasticity.  
- **Glucocorticoids** — Stress hormones that modulate neuron excitability and plasticity differently across brain regions.  
- **GABA-ergic neurons** — Neurons that release GABA, an inhibitory neurotransmitter decreasing excitability in target neurons.  
- **Hebbian plasticity** — The principle that synapses strengthen when the presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons are repeatedly activated together.  
- **Hippocampus** — A brain region critical for explicit memory, spatial navigation, and a primary site of adult neurogenesis and LTP.  
- **Inverted-U** — A concept describing how moderate stress enhances plasticity while excessive stress impairs it.  
- **LTP (Long-Term Potentiation)** — A sustained increase in synaptic strength following repeated activation, fundamental for learning and memory.  
- **LTD (Long-Term Depression)** — A long-lasting decrease in synaptic efficacy, involved in refining neural circuits by weakening unnecessary connections.  
- **Motor cortex** — Brain region controlling voluntary movements, capable of plastic changes during skill acquisition.  
- **NCAM (Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule)** — A molecule that stabilizes synapses and supports synaptic plasticity.  
- **NMDA receptor** — A glutamate receptor that acts as a coincidence detector and is crucial for inducing LTP through nonlinear activation.  
- **Non-NMDA receptor** — A glutamate receptor mediating typical excitatory postsynaptic responses before NMDA receptor activation.  
- **Pattern separation** — The neural process, aided by new neurons, distinguishing similar inputs into distinct memories or representations.  
- **Prefrontal cortex** — Brain region involved in executive functions, impulse control, and regulating emotional responses; sensitive to stress-induced plasticity.  
- **Presynaptic terminal** — The axon ending of a neuron that releases neurotransmitters into the synapse.  
- **Sensory cortex** — Brain areas processing sensory input that can remap in response to experience or injury.  
- **Synapse** — The junction between neurons where neurotransmitter signaling occurs; site of plastic changes underlying memory.  
- **Synaptogenesis** — The formation of new synapses, often following activity-dependent plasticity such as LTP.  
- **Testosterone** — A hormone that increases excitability of amygdaloid neurons, influencing behavior and plasticity.  
- **Visual cortex** — Brain region processing visual information, capable of remapping in response to sensory loss or training.  
- **Voluntary running** — An activity that can trigger beneficial dendritic expansion and neuroplasticity, modulating stress effects.

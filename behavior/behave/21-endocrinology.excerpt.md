Endocrinology studies hormones, chemical messengers released into the bloodstream that can affect target cells throughout the body over hours to days, unlike the rapid, localized action of neurotransmitters. Hormones operate via specific receptors on target cells, often within complex neuroendocrine axes involving the hypothalamus, pituitary, and peripheral glands, with effects ranging from altering protein activity to regulating growth and development.

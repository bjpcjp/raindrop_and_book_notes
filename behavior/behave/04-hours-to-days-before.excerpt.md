Hormones like testosterone, oxytocin, and vasopressin influence behavior by amplifying preexisting tendencies and social contexts rather than directly causing actions such as aggression or prosociality. Sustained stress adversely affects brain function, impairing emotional regulation, empathy, and decision-making, thereby increasing reactive aggression and reducing prosocial behavior.

This book emphasizes that scientific facts generally describe averages amid wide individual variation and that human behavior and biology are deeply complex, shaped by continuous interactions between genes, environment, and culture. Despite this complexity and uncertainty, the author urges readers—who are fortunate in many ways—to persist in efforts to understand and improve the world, affirming that one can be both scientific and compassionate.

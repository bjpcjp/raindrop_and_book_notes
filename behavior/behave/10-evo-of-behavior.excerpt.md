The evolution of behavior is shaped by three foundational processes: individual selection, kin selection, and reciprocal altruism, each explaining diverse adaptive and seemingly altruistic behaviors in animals and humans. These evolutionary mechanisms, alongside the debate over gradual versus punctuated evolutionary change and the reemergence of group selection concepts, provide a comprehensive framework for understanding the complexity and variability of social behaviors across species.

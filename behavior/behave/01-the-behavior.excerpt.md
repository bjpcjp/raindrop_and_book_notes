This book explores the complex biology underlying a wide range of human behaviors—from aggression to altruism—highlighting the challenges of defining these terms due to their context dependency and varied disciplinary perspectives. It emphasizes that behaviors traditionally labeled as good or bad are better understood through their situational meanings and the nuanced interplay of emotions, intentions, and evolutionary influences.

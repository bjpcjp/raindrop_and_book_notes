Empathy involves a continuum of emotional and cognitive resonances with anotherâ€™s pain, underpinned by brain regions like the anterior cingulate cortex and modulated by factors such as perspective taking and social closeness. However, feeling empathy does not guarantee compassionate action, which often requires a detached, automatic moral imperative rather than intense vicarious distress, and genuine altruism is frequently intertwined with self-interest and internal or external rewards.

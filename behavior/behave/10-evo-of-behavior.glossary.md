- **Adelphic (fraternal) polyandry** — A mating system where a woman marries all the brothers of one family, common in regions like northern India, Tibet, and Nepal.  
- **Allomothering** — Behavior where an adolescent female helps care for her mother’s offspring, gaining maternal experience.  
- **Antagonistic pleiotropy** — Traits that increase reproductive fitness early in life but reduce lifespan later (e.g., primate prostates).  
- **Bruce effect** — Pregnant females miscarry if they detect the scent of a new male, avoiding investment in offspring likely to be killed.  
- **Cinderella effect** — Higher incidence of child abuse or killing by stepparents than biological parents, explained by individual selection.  
- **Green-beard effect** — A genetic phenomenon where a gene codes for a conspicuous trait and cooperation with others having the same trait, enabling recognition and altruism.  
- **Imprinted genes** — Genes expressed differently depending on parental origin, involved in conflicts over fetal growth between maternal and paternal interests.  
- **Individual selection** — Evolutionary process where behaviors maximize an individual’s gene copies passed on, explaining acts like infanticide.  
- **Kin selection** — Evolutionary strategy favoring behaviors that help relatives reproduce, weighted by degree of genetic relatedness.  
- **Major histocompatibility complex (MHC)** — A gene cluster producing unique proteins that aid in immune function and olfactory kin recognition.  
- **Multilevel selection** — The concept that natural selection operates at various levels—genes, individuals, groups, and phenotypes.  
- **Neotenized** — Retaining juvenile traits into adulthood, sometimes affecting social bonding as in humans with pets.  
- **Neo–group selection** — Contemporary view that group-level selection can occur when groups with cooperative traits outcompete others, especially in humans.  
- **Punctuated equilibrium** — Evolutionary model proposing long periods of stasis interrupted by rapid bursts of change.  
- **Pseudoestrus** — Female animals falsely indicating fertility to counter infanticidal males.  
- **Pseudokinship** — The perception or feeling of relatedness to others regardless of actual genetic ties.  
- **Pseudospeciation** — Propagandist-driven dehumanization of out-groups, portraying them as subhuman or vermin.  
- **Reciprocal altruism** — Cooperation between unrelated individuals where fitness costs are incurred with the expectation of future reciprocation.  
- **Selfish gene** — The gene-centered view of evolution focused on gene replication, popularized by Richard Dawkins.  
- **Signal error** — Miscommunication or misunderstanding in interactions (e.g., cooperation/defection signals) that can disrupt reciprocal altruism.  
- **Social groups (eusociality)** — Groups like ant, bee, or termite colonies where most individuals are nonreproductive workers, explained by kin selection.  
- **Sociobiology** — The study of how social behaviors are shaped and optimized by evolutionary processes.  
- **Spatial assortment** — Mechanism where cooperative individuals cluster spatially, facilitating the start of reciprocal altruism.  
- **Tit for Tat** — A game theory strategy that starts with cooperation and then mimics an opponent’s previous action, promoting reciprocity.  
- **Tournament species** — Species with high male-male competition, sexual dimorphism, and skewed reproductive success favoring a few dominant males.  
- **Unrelated cooperation** — Instances where individuals cooperate despite not being closely related, often explained by reciprocal altruism.  
- **Weaning conflict** — Disagreement between mother and offspring over cessation of nursing, illustrating parent-offspring conflict.

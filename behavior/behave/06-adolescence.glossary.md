- **Adolescence** — A developmental period marked by delayed maturation of the frontal cortex, heightened emotional intensity, increased risk taking, novelty seeking, and social sensitivity.
- **Amygdala** — A brain region involved in processing emotions and fear, showing heightened activity in adolescents during emotional tasks.
- **Anterior cingulate** — Brain region associated with pain perception, emotion regulation, and the response to social exclusion.
- **Autonomic systems** — Bodily systems that operate involuntarily, such as heart rate and digestion, active during adolescence alongside emotional systems.
- **Brain plasticity** — The brain’s ability to change structurally and functionally in response to experience, especially prominent in the developing frontal cortex.
- **Cyberball paradigm** — An experimental social exclusion task used to study neural responses to being socially snubbed.
- **Dendritic branches** — Extensions from neurons that receive synaptic inputs, pruned during adolescent brain development.
- **Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC)** — Evolutionarily newer frontal cortex subregion important for cognitive control and executive functions, maturing late in adolescence.
- **Emotional regulation** — The ability to manage and respond to emotional experiences, improving during adolescence as the prefrontal cortex matures.
- **Empathy** — The capacity to feel and understand another’s emotional state; adolescents experience intense empathic responses often leading to hyperarousal.
- **Executive control** — Cognitive processes involving planning, inhibition, task switching, and flexible rule use, reliant on mature frontal cortex function.
- **Frontal cortex** — Brain region responsible for complex cognition, decision-making, impulse control, emotional regulation, and social behavior; matures fully only in the mid-twenties.
- **Functional connectivity** — Coordination and communication among different brain regions, enhanced by increased myelination during adolescence.
- **Gonadal hormones** — Hormones such as estrogen, progesterone, and testosterone that influence brain development and function during puberty.
- **Gray matter** — Brain tissue comprising neuronal cell bodies and dendrites; peaks in adolescence before being pruned to increase efficiency.
- **Intergenerational conflict** — A cultural phenomenon of tension between adolescents and adults, less common in collectivist societies.
- **Limbic system** — Brain region involved in emotion and motivation, highly active in adolescents relative to the still-developing frontal cortex.
- **Mesolimbic dopamine pathway** — Dopamine projection system from the ventral tegmentum to the nucleus accumbens, involved in reward processing and heightened during adolescence.
- **Myelination** — The process of insulating neuronal axons to speed communication, which continues and increases in the frontal cortex throughout adolescence.
- **Novelty seeking** — A heightened drive during adolescence to explore new experiences, foods, music, and social groups.
- **Periaqueductal gray** — Brain area involved in pain perception and responses to social exclusion.
- **Prefrontal cortex (PFC)** — Part of the frontal cortex managing executive function, emotional regulation, and social cognition; matures late in adolescence.
- **Programmed cell death** — The genetic process by which excess neurons are pruned during fetal and adolescent development to optimize brain circuits.
- **Reappraisal** — A cognitive emotion regulation strategy involving reinterpreting emotional stimuli to reduce their impact.
- **Social exclusion** — Being deliberately ignored or left out socially, which elicits stronger emotional and neural responses in adolescents than adults.
- **Synaptic pruning** — The reduction of synapses during adolescence to eliminate less efficient neural connections and enhance brain efficiency.
- **Ventral striatum** — A subcortical brain region involved in emotion regulation and reward responsiveness, which assists the immature frontal cortex in adolescence.
- **Ventral tegmentum** — Midbrain region that produces dopamine, projecting to reward-related areas such as the nucleus accumbens and prefrontal cortex.
- **vmPFC (ventromedial prefrontal cortex)** — Frontal cortex area implicated in emotion regulation and habituation to emotional stimuli; shows delayed activation in adolescents.

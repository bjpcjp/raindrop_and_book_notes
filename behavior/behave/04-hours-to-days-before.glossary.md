- **ACTH (Adrenocorticotropic Hormone)** — Hormone released by the pituitary gland that stimulates glucocorticoid secretion from the adrenal glands during stress.  
- **Androgens** — Male sex hormones, primarily testosterone and related hormones, involved in aggression and other behaviors.  
- **Amygdala** — Brain region involved in processing emotions, particularly fear and aggression; heavily influenced by hormones like testosterone and glucocorticoids.  
- **BDNF (Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor)** — A growth factor that promotes the formation of dendrites and synapses, enhanced by stress in the amygdala.  
- **Chemical Castration** — Medical treatment using drugs to inhibit testosterone production or block its receptors, reducing sexual urges but not necessarily aggression.  
- **Dopamine** — Neurotransmitter involved in reward and pleasure pathways, increased by testosterone in brain regions like the ventral tegmentum and nucleus accumbens.  
- **Estradiol (Estrogen)** — A form of estrogen hormone with multiple brain receptor types mediating different effects, including aggression and empathy.  
- **Fusiform Face Area** — Brain region involved in facial recognition whose activation can be influenced by oxytocin receptor gene variants.  
- **Glucocorticoids** — Stress hormones released from the adrenal glands that mobilize energy and affect brain regions like the amygdala and prefrontal cortex.  
- **Hypothalamic/Pituitary/Testicular Axis** — Hormonal system regulating testosterone production and secretion.  
- **Intranasal Administration** — Method of delivering hormones like oxytocin through the nose to bypass the blood-brain barrier.  
- **Neuropeptides** — Small protein-like hormones such as oxytocin and vasopressin that influence brain function and social behaviors.  
- **Nucleus Accumbens** — Brain region linked to reward, motivation, and pair bonding, influenced by oxytocin, vasopressin, and testosterone.  
- **Oxytocin** — Hormone/neuropeptide involved in maternal behavior, social bonding, trust, and stress reduction, with context-dependent prosocial and antisocial effects.  
- **PMS (Premenstrual Syndrome)** — Biological mood and behavioral changes associated with menstruation, including irritability but minimal aggression links.  
- **PMDD (Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder)** — Severe form of PMS causing significant impairment in daily functioning.  
- **Prefrontal Cortex (PFC)** — Brain region critical for decision-making, impulse control, and executive function, impaired by stress and hormonal modulation.  
- **Progesterone** — Hormone involved in the menstrual cycle and maternal aggression; metabolized in the brain into neurosteroids that modulate anxiety.  
- **Reactive Aggression** — Aggression triggered by perceived threats or provocations, enhanced by testosterone and stress hormones in predisposed individuals.  
- **Social Learning** — Process by which behaviors such as aggression become established and maintained independently of hormones.  
- **Stress Response** — Neural and endocrine changes activated by stressors to restore homeostasis, including activation of the amygdala and release of glucocorticoids and catecholamines.  
- **Sustained Stress** — Chronic activation of the stress response leading to impaired cognition, increased fear, poor risk assessment, reduced empathy, and increased impulsivity.  
- **Testosterone** — Steroid hormone traditionally linked to male aggression; instead, it amplifies preexisting aggressive tendencies and status-maintaining behaviors, context-dependent.  
- **The Challenge Hypothesis** — Theory that testosterone levels rise during social challenges, amplifying behaviors needed to maintain status rather than causing aggression directly.  
- **Tend-and-Befriend** — Female stress response model emphasizing nurturing and seeking social support, often involving oxytocin.  
- **Vasopressin** — Neuropeptide similar to oxytocin, involved in paternal behavior, social bonding, and context-dependent aggression.  
- **Ventromedial Tegmental Area (VTA)** — Brain region producing dopamine, involved in reward; influenced by hormones like testosterone and oxytocin.  
- **Xenophobia** — Negative or hostile attitudes toward outsiders, which can be heightened by oxytocin under certain social contexts.

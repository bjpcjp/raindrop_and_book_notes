- **ACC (anterior cingulate cortex)** — Brain region involved in monitoring conflict between competing choices, including cognitive conflict during deception.  
- **Altruistic punishment** — Punishing someone for treating a third party unfairly, at a personal cost to the punisher.  
- **Antisocial punishment** — Punishing someone for being more generous than oneself, often due to fear of normative pressure.  
- **Amygdala** — Brain region involved in emotional responses, particularly in moral intuition such as anger or fear related to moral violations.  
- **Automatic moral intuition** — Rapid, implicit moral judgments driven by emotion rather than deliberate reasoning.  
- **Behavioral economics** — Field studying economic decision-making incorporating psychological insights, including fairness and cooperation experiments.  
- **Cognitive conflict** — Mental tension arising when two or more competing responses or beliefs interfere with each other.  
- **Cognitive moral reasoning** — Deliberate, logical analysis of moral situations, typically involving higher brain functions like the dlPFC.  
- **Commission vs. omission bias** — The tendency to judge actively causing harm (commission) as morally worse than passively allowing harm (omission), even when consequences are equivalent.  
- **Consequentialism** — Moral philosophy focusing on the outcomes or consequences of actions to determine right and wrong.  
- **Cortical (dlPFC) activation** — Engagement of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex associated with logical reasoning, self-control, and moral deliberation.  
- **Cultural moral universals** — Morality rules found across cultures, typically involving harm, fairness, loyalty, authority, and purity.  
- **Deontology** — Moral philosophy focusing on the inherent rightness or wrongness of actions, regardless of consequences.  
- **DlPFC (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex)** — Brain area involved in executive functions, logical reasoning, moral deliberation, and resisting temptation.  
- **Emotional moral intuition** — Moral judgments guided by emotional centers like the vmPFC, amygdala, and insula.  
- **Frontal cortex** — Brain region critical for executive function, decision making, and control over impulses.  
- **Guilt** — Internal moral emotion focused on self-evaluation of actions, typical in individualistic cultures.  
- **Honor cultures** — Societies where personal and family reputation and revenge for affronts to honor hold strong moral importance.  
- **Intentionality in moral judgment** — Assessment of moral actions based on whether harm was intended or a side effect, influencing moral decisions.  
- **Moral dumbfounding** — Situation where individuals hold strong moral beliefs but cannot provide rational reasons for them, often followed by post-hoc rationalizations.  
- **Moral intuitionism (social intuitionism)** — Theory that moral judgments are primarily intuitive and emotional, with reasoning occurring mostly as post-hoc justification.  
- **Moral reasoning** — Conscious, deliberate thought process aimed at determining right and wrong.  
- **Neuroethics** — Scientific study combining neuroscience and ethics, often using imaging to understand moral decision making.  
- **Piagetian stages** — Developmental stages of cognitive reasoning influencing moral reasoning, foundational to Kohlberg’s moral development theory.  
- **Public goods game** — Economic experiment testing cooperation, contribution to shared resources, and punishment behaviors.  
- **Shame** — External judgment by the group focusing on the individual’s entire identity, typical in collectivist cultures.  
- **Social intuitionism** — Perspective emphasizing the emotional and social basis of moral judgments, pioneered by Jonathan Haidt.  
- **Theory of Mind (ToM)** — Cognitive capacity to understand others’ beliefs, desires, and intentions, crucial in moral assessments.  
- **Third-party punishment** — Punishing someone for unfair behavior toward others, even when the punisher is not directly affected.  
- **Trolley problem** — Thought experiment highlighting conflict between utilitarian and deontological moral reasoning by involving sacrifice to save others.  
- **Utilitarianism** — Consequentialist moral philosophy advocating actions that maximize overall happiness or well-being.  
- **VmPFC (ventromedial prefrontal cortex)** — Brain area involved in emotional processing and moral intuition, particularly in judgments requiring empathy or valuing close relationships.  
- **White matter in frontal cortex** — Neural connections increased in some habitual liars, facilitating complex executive functioning during deception.

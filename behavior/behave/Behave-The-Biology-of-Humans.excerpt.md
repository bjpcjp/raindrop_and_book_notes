This book explores the complex biology underlying human behaviors such as aggression, violence, empathy, and cooperation, emphasizing that these behaviors cannot be understood through a single disciplinary perspective but rather through an integrated view of neurobiology, hormones, genetics, development, culture, and evolution. Central to this understanding are brain structures like the amygdala and frontal cortex, which mediate emotional responses and executive control, illustrating how humans can both harm and care for one another in profoundly context-dependent ways.

Neuroplasticity encompasses the brain's capacity to reorganize itself through mechanisms such as long-term potentiation, synaptogenesis, axonal sprouting, and adult neurogenesis, enabling substantial structural and functional changes over days to months. These processes are influenced by factors like stress, hormones, and experience, contributing to both adaptive learning and pathological conditions, and highlighting the brain's dynamic potential for change throughout life.

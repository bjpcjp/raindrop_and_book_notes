This chapter explores how culture and biology coevolve, examining systematic patterns of cultural variation shaped by ecology, social organization, and historical factors, including collectivist versus individualist cultures, stratified versus egalitarian societies, population dynamics, and the residues of cultural crises. It also addresses the longstanding debate on human violence, presenting archaeological and anthropological evidence both supporting and challenging the prevalence of warfare in prehistoric and contemporary tribal societies.

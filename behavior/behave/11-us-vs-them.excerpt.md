Humans have a deeply ingrained and rapid tendency to categorize people into Us versus Them groups, which influences emotions, cognition, and behaviors across cultures and ages, often exacerbated by arbitrary markers and essentialist thinking. While this dichotomizing can lead to prejudice and conflict, it also fosters trust and cooperation within groups, making the complete elimination of Us/Them thinking neither possible nor desirable, though awareness, perspective-taking, and individuation can mitigate its harmful effects.

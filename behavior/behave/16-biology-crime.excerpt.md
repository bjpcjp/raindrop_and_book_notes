This chapter explores the complex interplay between neuroscience, free will, and the criminal justice system, arguing that biology significantly constrains behavior and challenges traditional notions of moral responsibility. It advocates for a radical reevaluation of punishment and legal responsibility grounded in scientific understanding while acknowledging the difficulty of abandoning the deeply ingrained belief in free will.

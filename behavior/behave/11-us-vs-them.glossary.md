- **Affect** — Emotional response or feeling that influences perceptions and behaviors towards Us and Them.  
- **Amygdala** — Brain region involved in automatic, emotional reactions to in-group and out-group faces, especially in Us/Them distinctions.  
- **Cognitive Load** — The mental effort required for executive control, which can influence the expression of implicit biases.  
- **Cognitive Rationalization** — Post-hoc justifications used to explain intuitive or emotional biases against Them.  
- **Disgust** — Emotional reaction often directed at out-groups, linked to moral and aesthetic rejection, processed in the insular cortex.  
- **Essentialism** — Belief that out-groups (Thems) have a fixed, homogeneous, and unchangeable negative essence.  
- **Green-Beard Effect** — Favoritism based on an arbitrary, identifiable trait signaling in-group membership and cooperative behavior.  
- **Hierarchy** — Social structure of power and status differences that can exacerbate Us/Them biases and justify inequalities.  
- **Implicit Association Test (IAT)** — A test measuring unconscious biases by assessing reaction times to paired images or words related to groups and traits.  
- **In-Group** — The social group identified as Us, favored emotionally and behaviorally over out-groups.  
- **Individuation** — The cognitive process of perceiving out-group members as distinct individuals, reducing essentialism and bias.  
- **Minimal Group Paradigm** — Experimental condition where even arbitrary group assignments produce in-group favoritism and bias.  
- **Neurobiology of Us/Them** — Brain mechanisms including the amygdala, insula, and hormone oxytocin that underlie rapid group categorization and bias.  
- **Oxytocin** — Hormone that increases trust and cooperation within Us but can heighten aggression or bias toward Them.  
- **Perspective Taking** — Deliberately adopting the viewpoint of out-group members to reduce bias and increase empathy.  
- **Prefrontal Cortex (PFC)** — Brain region involved in regulating emotional responses, controlling prejudice expression, and executive function.  
- **Primary Us/Them Categories** — Social categories such as race, gender, or ethnicity that are rapidly and automatically used to judge others.  
- **Recategorization** — Shifting cognitive focus from negative group-based categorization to shared traits or individuality, reducing bias.  
- **Right-Wing Authoritarianism (RWA)** — Personality trait valuing authority, conformity, and order, associated with higher Us/Them prejudice.  
- **Schadenfreude** — Pleasure derived from the misfortune of out-groups.  
- **Social Dominance Orientation (SDO)** — Preference for hierarchy and dominance, predicting acceptance and expression of prejudice.  
- **Stereotype Content Model** — Framework categorizing out-groups by perceived warmth and competence, influencing emotions like envy, pity, or disgust.  
- **Subliminal Priming** — Unconscious exposure to stimuli that can activate or reduce Us/Them biases.  
- **System-Justifying Stereotypes** — Beliefs that support existing social hierarchies by attributing certain traits to in-groups and out-groups.  
- **Them (Out-Group)** — The social group identified as Other, often perceived negatively as threatening, disgusting, or simplistic.  
- **Trust and Reciprocity** — Expectations and behaviors favoring cooperation and amends within Us groups rather than with Thems.  
- **Us (In-Group)** — A social collective with shared values, obligations, and mutual cooperation, seen as morally and cognitively superior to Them.  
- **Us/Them-ing** — The cognitive and emotional process of dividing people into in-groups and out-groups, favoring Us over Them.

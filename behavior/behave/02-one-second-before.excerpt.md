The chapter explores the neurobiological underpinnings of behavior by examining what occurs in the brain one second before an action, focusing on the roles of the triune brain layers, particularly the limbic system, frontal cortex, and mesolimbic/mesocortical dopamine system. It emphasizes how the amygdala mediates fear, anxiety, and aggression, the frontal cortex enables executive control and social decision-making, and the dopamine system drives reward anticipation and motivation, all intricately interacting to influence complex human behaviors.

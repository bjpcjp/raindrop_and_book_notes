The nervous system is characterized by neurons that communicate rapidly through electrical action potentials and chemical neurotransmitters across synapses, forming complex, highly organized networks that integrate excitatory and inhibitory signals to mediate behavior. This intricate signaling and structural organization, including specialized neurotransmitters and modulatory circuits, enable precise control and contrast enhancement essential for brain function.

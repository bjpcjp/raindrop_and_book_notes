- **Action potential** — A wave of electrical excitation in a neuron characterized by a rapid positive shift in internal charge that propagates along the axon to transmit signals to other neurons.  
- **Analogue signal** — Graded, continuous electrical signals in dendrites that diminish over time and distance.  
- **Axon** — A long cable-like neuron process that carries an action potential from the cell body toward axon terminals.  
- **Axon hillock** — A specialized area at the base of the axon where summated dendritic inputs must reach a threshold to trigger an action potential.  
- **Axon terminal** — The end point of an axon that releases neurotransmitters to communicate with the next neuron’s dendrites.  
- **Dendrites** — Branch-like structures on neurons that receive incoming signals from other neurons.  
- **Dendritic spines** — Small protrusions on dendrites that form synapses with axon terminals from other neurons.  
- **Digital signal** — An all-or-none electrical signal (action potential) that is regenerated down the axon without diminishing.  
- **Excitatory neurotransmitter** — A chemical messenger that depolarizes the postsynaptic neuron, increasing the likelihood of firing an action potential.  
- **Feed-forward inhibition** — A circuit mechanism where an inhibitory neuron is activated with a delay, sharpening the timing of excitation in a target neuron.  
- **Feedback inhibition** — An inhibitory circuit in which an excited neuron activates another neuron that, in turn, inhibits the original neuron, helping to terminate signaling.  
- **Glia (glial cells)** — Non-neuronal brain cells that provide support, insulation, and maintenance functions for neurons.  
- **Hyperpolarization** — An increase in the negative charge inside a neuron making it less likely to fire an action potential; typically caused by inhibitory neurotransmitters.  
- **Inhibitory neurotransmitter** — A chemical messenger that hyperpolarizes the postsynaptic neuron, decreasing the likelihood of firing an action potential.  
- **Lateral inhibition** — Circuitry where an excited neuron inhibits neighboring neurons, enhancing the contrast and spatial resolution of signals.  
- **Myelin sheath** — An insulating layer formed by glial cells around axons that increases the speed of action potential propagation.  
- **Neuroactive drugs** — Substances that modulate neurotransmitter signaling either by increasing or decreasing synaptic communication.  
- **Neurotransmitters** — Chemicals released from axon terminals that bind to receptors on postsynaptic neurons to transmit signals across synapses.  
- **Neuron** — The primary cell type of the nervous system that transmits electrical signals through specialized processes to communicate with other neurons.  
- **Neuron doctrine** — The principle that neurons are discrete, individual cells separated by synaptic gaps, not forming a fused network.  
- **Neuropharmacology** — The study of how drugs affect neurotransmitter systems and neuronal signaling.  
- **Neuromodulation** — The regulation of neurotransmitter release or action at synapses by other neurons, often via inhibitory axoaxonic synapses.  
- **Postsynaptic neuron** — The neuron receiving communication at the synapse through its dendritic spines.  
- **Presynaptic neuron** — The neuron sending signals by releasing neurotransmitters from its axon terminals.  
- **Receptor** — A protein on the postsynaptic membrane that specifically binds neurotransmitters to trigger ion channel opening and neuronal excitation or inhibition.  
- **Resting potential** — The actively maintained negative internal electrical charge of a neuron when it is not signaling, typically about –70 mV.  
- **Reuptake pumps** — Membrane proteins in the presynaptic axon terminal that reclaim neurotransmitters from the synapse for recycling.  
- **Synapse** — The microscopic gap between the axon terminal of one neuron and the dendritic spine of another where neurotransmitter communication occurs.  
- **Threshold** — The critical level of depolarization (around –40 mV at the axon hillock) needed to trigger an action potential.  
- **White matter** — Brain regions composed mainly of myelinated axon fiber tracts that connect different neuronal nuclei and regions.

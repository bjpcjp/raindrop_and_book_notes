Adolescence is characterized by delayed maturation of the frontal cortex, which continues developing into the mid-twenties through synaptic pruning and increased myelination, leading to greater cognitive efficiency and emotional regulation. This developmental trajectory underlies adolescents' heightened risk-taking, novelty seeking, peer influence sensitivity, intense empathy, and incomplete self-regulation compared to adults.

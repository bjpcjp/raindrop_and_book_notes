Human hierarchies, similar to those in other social species, involve complex status differences that deeply affect brain function, physiology, and behavior, with rank influencing health and stress based on social context and personality. Unlike other animals, humans belong to multiple hierarchies, choose leaders based on both conscious and unconscious biases, and exhibit conformity and obedience that, while necessary for social order, can also lead to harmful behaviors, though resistance and heroism remain possible and significant.

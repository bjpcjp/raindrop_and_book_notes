- **Amino acids** — Building blocks of proteins; about 20 different types exist, each protein is a unique string of these.  
- **Allele** — Different versions of the same gene that may result in variations in traits within a population.  
- **Central dogma** — The principle that DNA sequence determines RNA sequence, which determines amino acid sequence, shaping protein structure and function.  
- **Chromosome** — A volume of DNA in the cell nucleus, containing many genes.  
- **Codon** — A sequence of three nucleotides in DNA or RNA that codes for a single amino acid.  
- **Deletion mutation** — A mutation in which one or more nucleotides are missing from the DNA sequence.  
- **DNA** — A class of organic molecules composed of four nucleotide types; contains genetic instructions for proteins.  
- **Enzyme** — A type of protein that catalyzes biochemical reactions, often changing shape to facilitate the reaction.  
- **Gene** — A stretch of DNA coding for a single type of protein.  
- **Genome** — The complete set of DNA in an organism containing all its genes.  
- **Insertion mutation** — A mutation where extra nucleotide(s) are inserted into the DNA sequence.  
- **Messenger** — Hormones or neurotransmitters made of proteins that transmit signals in the body.  
- **Mutations** — Changes in DNA sequence including point, deletion, and insertion mutations; can affect protein function.  
- **Nucleotide** — The basic building block of DNA and RNA, represented by four types: A, C, G, and T in DNA.  
- **Phenotype** — Not explicitly defined, but implied as observable traits affected by genetic variations (alleles).  
- **Point mutation** — A mutation where a single nucleotide is incorrectly copied, possibly altering the amino acid coded.  
- **Polymorphism** — The presence of multiple alleles of a gene in a population, causing variation in traits.  
- **Protein** — Organic molecules made from amino acid chains; shape determines their specific biological function.  
- **Redundancy** — The genetic code has multiple codons coding for the same amino acid, providing tolerance against some mutations.  
- **RNA** — A related compound to DNA that copies gene sequences and directs protein synthesis in the cell.  
- **Scaffolding** — Structural proteins that give shape and support to cells.  
- **Shape (of protein)** — The three-dimensional form of a protein that determines its function and interaction with other molecules.  
- **Stop codon** — Nucleotide triplets in DNA/RNA signaling the end of protein-coding sequences.  
- **Substitution mutation** — A point mutation where one nucleotide is replaced with another, potentially changing the amino acid coded.  
- **Temperature and acidity effects** — Environmental factors that can subtly alter protein shape and function.  
- **Transcription** — The process of copying DNA sequences into RNA molecules (implied but not explicitly defined).  
- **Translation** — The process of assembling amino acids into proteins directed by RNA sequences (implied).  
- **Variant** — Different forms of a gene (alleles) that produce variations in proteins and traits.

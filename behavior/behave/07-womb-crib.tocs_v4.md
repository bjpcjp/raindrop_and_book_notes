- **Complexification**
  - Childhood behavior, thought, and emotion develop in universal, stereotypical stages.
  - Experience influences the speed and certainty of developmental maturation.
  - Most child behavioral development research is implicitly stage oriented.
  - For more on developmental psychology, see [Child Development Stages](https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/childdevelopment/positiveparenting/toddlers.html).

- **A Brief Tour of Brain Development**
  - Neuron formation, migration, and synapse creation mainly occur prenatally in humans.
  - Myelination of axons continues into young adulthood, facilitating interregional brain communication.
  - The later a brain region matures, the more it is influenced by environment versus genes.
  - White matter development is crucial for functions like language comprehension and production.
  - See [Brain Development Basics](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/child-and-adolescent-mental-health).

- **Stages**
  - Jean Piaget identified four cognitive development stages: sensorimotor, preoperational, concrete operational, formal operational.
  - Theory of Mind (ToM) development occurs progressively: gaze following, primary ToM, secondary ToM, perspective taking.
  - ToM regions include medial PFC, precuneus, superior temporal sulcus, and TPJ.
  - Social and motivational factors influence cognitive development stages.
  - For details, consult [Piaget's Stages of Cognitive Development](https://www.simplypsychology.org/piaget.html).

- **Feeling Someone Else's Pain**
  - Toddlers show rudimentary empathy by responding to others' distress even before ToM develops.
  - Empathic brain regions, including anterior cingulate cortex, amygdala, and insula, activate upon observing pain.
  - Empathy in children progresses from self-focused pain to more abstracted empathic responses.
  - A growing sense of justice develops, initially self-interested, later more generalized but influenced by bias.
  - See [Understanding Empathy Development](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5519439/).

- **Moral Development**
  - Kohlberg's three-level, six-stage moral development theory progresses from preconventional to postconventional reasoning.
  - Early stages focus on punishment and reward; conventional stages involve social relationships and law; postconventional stages involve conscience and personal ethics.
  - Criticisms include cultural bias, gender differences (Gilligan's care vs. justice), and the role of intuition and emotion.
  - Moral reasoning rarely predict moral action directly.
  - Reference: [Kohlberg’s Theory of Moral Development](https://www.skillsyouneed.com/ps/kohlberg-moral.html).

- **Marshmallows**
  - The marshmallow test measures children's ability to delay gratification with varying success strategies.
  - Older children use distraction and reappraisal more than younger children.
  - Long-term marshmallow patience predicts higher academic achievement, social success, and better frontal cortex functioning.
  - Environmental factors like trust influence children's delayed gratification.
  - Further reading: [The Marshmallow Test Study](https://www.apa.org/monitor/2011/12/marshmallow).

- **Consequences**
  - Childhood experiences, including malnutrition and parenting style, biologically affect adult cognition and emotion.
  - The developing brain's plasticity means minor childhood experiences influence adult behavior propensities.
  - Biology mediates both obvious (malnutrition/cognition) and subtle (cold parenting/self-esteem) links.
  - Neuroscientific advances validate the importance of childhood environment.
  - See [Neural Plasticity](https://www.sciencedaily.com/terms/neuroplasticity.htm).

- **Let's Start at the Very Beginning: The Importance of Mothers**
  - Maternal contact influences offspring stress physiology, cognition, and behavior across species.
  - Historical child-rearing minimized maternal contact, causing negative outcomes like hospitalism.
  - Bowlby's attachment theory established the importance of love, warmth, and responsiveness.
  - Harlow’s monkey experiments demonstrated preference for comfort over nutrition.
  - Maternal acceptance predicts positive adult outcomes; rejection correlates with criminality rates.
  - For attachment theory, see [Attachment Theory Basics](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/attachment-theory).

- **Any Kind of Mother in a Storm**
  - Infant attachment occurs regardless of quality, even to abusive caregivers, due to addiction-like bonding mechanisms.
  - Stress hyporesponsive period (SHRP) in rodents suppresses stress hormone release if the mother is present.
  - Early conditions program lifelong responses, explaining cycles of abuse.
  - Animal studies support parallels in human child abuse outcomes.
  - See [Effects of Early Attachment and Abuse](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2793550/).

- **Different Routes to the Same Place**
  - Varied childhood traumas converge biologically, increasing adult risks for depression, anxiety, cognitive impairment, impulse control issues, and antisocial behavior.
  - Despite adversity, many individuals show resilience influenced by the number of adversities and protective factors.
  - Biological mediators include stress hormones, brain region changes, and neural circuit adaptations.
  - Review resilience literature: [Childhood Resilience](https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/aces/resilience.html).

- **The Biological Profile**
  - Childhood adversity elevates glucocorticoids and sympathetic activity, causing prolonged stress responses.
  - Excess glucocorticoids impair hippocampal and frontal cortex development, affecting learning and emotion regulation.
  - Childhood poverty correlates with thinner frontal cortex, lower functionality, and impaired executive functions.
  - Adversity enlarges and sensitizes the amygdala, heightening anxiety risk.
  - Dopamine system dysfunction increases vulnerability to addiction and depression.
  - See [Effects of Childhood Stress on the Brain](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3032349/).

- **Two Side Topics**
  - Observing Violence: witnessing violence impairs concentration, increases aggression risk, and is linked with adult mental health issues.
  - Media Violence increases aggressive behavior in children, especially in those predisposed to violence.
  - Bullying: victims and perpetrators often have preexisting vulnerabilities; bully/victims show the worst long-term outcomes.
  - Social context and personal psychiatric history strongly influence these effects.
  - For bullying consequences, see [Bullying and Mental Health](https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/bullying-factsheet-2016.pdf).

- **A Key Question**
  - Childhood adversity increases risk but does not determine adult dysfunction; resilience varies widely.
  - The total load of adversities and protective family stability are key predictors of adult outcomes.
  - This underscores the multifactorial nature of developmental outcomes.

- **A Sledgehammer**
  - Severe deprivation (e.g., Romanian institutionalized children) causes profound cognitive, emotional, and brain structural deficits.
  - Institutionalization correlates with lower IQ, attachment problems, anxiety, and brain region abnormalities, notably enlarged amygdala.
  - Early intervention and adoption can mitigate but not always fully reverse damage.
  - For more, see [Romanian Orphan Studies](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16077046/).

- **Culture, With Both a Big and a Little C**
  - Culture shapes childhood experience through parenting styles, peer influence, and broader social context.
  - Baumrind's parenting typology: authoritative, authoritarian, permissive, and neglectful.
  - Parenting style influences adult emotional, social, and behavioral outcomes.
  - Peers become influential early, mediating social competence and cultural values.
  - Play teaches social skills and involves moderate stress and pleasure.
  - See [Parenting Styles and Culture](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/parenting/parenting-styles).

- **Collectivist Versus Individualist Cultures**
  - Collectivist cultures emphasize group harmony, fitting in, and social responsibility.
  - Individualist cultures prioritize autonomy, competition, and personal achievement.
  - Mothers in individualist cultures encourage assertiveness; collectivist mothers emphasize soothing and cooperation.
  - Collectivist children develop social cognitive abilities, like ToM, earlier.
  - Media violence effects differ by culture, with less impact in collectivist societies.
  - Reference: [Hofstede’s Cultural Dimensions](https://www.hofstede-insights.com/models/national-culture/).

- **Cultures of Honor**
  - Cultures of honor stress defending personal and family reputation with aggressive retribution.
  - Parenting tends to be authoritarian, endorsing aggressive responses to honor violations.
  - These cultures have higher rates of retaliatory violence and social enforcement.
  - For anthropological context, see [Culture of Honor](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3018850/).

- **Class Differences**
  - Class shapes parenting style: higher SES favors authoritative/permissive; lower SES favors authoritarian styles.
  - Lower SES parenting emphasizes protection and preparation for harsh environments.
  - Parenting speech and goals differ, reflecting social mobility and psychological vulnerabilities.
  - Anthropological studies illustrate neighborhood-based parenting and child-rearing models.
  - For socioeconomic impacts on parenting, see [Socioeconomic Status and Parenting](https://www.apa.org/pi/families/resources/newsletter/2014/12/socioeconomic).

- **Nine Long Months**
  - Fetuses can hear, taste, and remember prenatal sensory stimuli, influencing postnatal preferences.
  - Newborns recognize maternal voice and prefer familiar sounds learned prenatally.
  - Prenatal environment starts cultural transmission before birth.
  - For fetal learning, see [Fetal Auditory Learning](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2920619/).

- **Boy and Girl Brains, Whatever That Might Mean**
  - Fetal gonads secrete hormones (testosterone, estrogen) that organize brain sexual differentiation.
  - Testosterone converts to estrogen in the brain to effect masculinization.
  - Alpha-fetoprotein in females prevents maternal/fetal estrogen from masculinizing female brains.
  - Sex differences are most evident in hormone-driven behaviors like aggression and play styles.
  - For brain sexual differentiation, see [Sex Hormones and Brain Development](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5287720/).

- **And Us**
  - Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) girls show masculinized behaviors due to prenatal androgen exposure.
  - Androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS) individuals raised female display female-typical behaviors despite XY genotype.
  - Behavioral effects of prenatal testosterone are significant but modulated by social and medical factors.
  - The 2D:4D digit ratio serves as a proxy for prenatal testosterone exposure with small predictive effects.
  - For further understanding, see [Prenatal Hormones and Behavior](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3197907/).

- **Expanding the Scope of “Environment”**
  - Maternal nutrition, infection, substance abuse, and stress impact fetal brain development.
  - Maternal glucocorticoids cross the placenta, with organizational effects causing lifelong changes.
  - Epigenetic mechanisms regulate gene expression permanently or transiently due to early environment.
  - Epigenetic effects have been demonstrated in rodent mothering and stress-response genes.
  - For epigenetics and development, see [Epigenetics in Neuroscience](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrn3818).

- **Conclusions**
  - Epigenetics and neural plasticity explain childhood environment’s influence on adult behavior propensities.
  - Most aspects of childhood experience affect adult outcomes through biological pathways.
  - The insights help frame targeted interventions and validate the critical importance of nurturing childhoods.
  - Childhood environments set biological and behavioral trajectories via multiple interacting mechanisms.

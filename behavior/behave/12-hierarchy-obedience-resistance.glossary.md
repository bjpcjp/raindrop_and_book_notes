- **Amygdala** — Brain region involved in threat perception and emotional responses, particularly activated by status ambiguity and disgust.  
- **Authority** — A figure or institution perceived as legitimate and commanding obedience and conformity.  
- **Binding Foundations** — Moral values emphasized by conservatives including loyalty, authority, and sanctity.  
- **Challenge Hypothesis** — The idea that elevated testosterone reflects responses to social challenges rather than dominance per se.  
- **Common Good** — An ideal goal that leaders attempt to maximize through leadership.  
- **Conformity** — Going along with the group, often to fit in or avoid social punishment.  
- **Cortical Regions** — Brain areas, such as the prefrontal cortex, involved in complex social processing including theory of mind and dominance recognition.  
- **Disgust Sensitivity** — Variance in threshold to visceral disgust, higher in conservatives and linked to moral and social attitudes.  
- **Dunbar’s Number** — Approximate predicted average size of traditional human social groups (~150), linked to neocortex size.  
- **Executive Stress Syndrome** — Stress experienced by high-status individuals due to control and responsibility.  
- **Fission-Fusion Species** — Species where group size and composition regularly change, complicating dominance relations.  
- **Glucocorticoids** — Stress hormones elevated in subordinate individuals, associated with health detriments.  
- **Hierarchy** — A system ranking individuals with unequal access to resources and power.  
- **Internal Standards** — Personal criteria judging success or failure beyond objective social rank.  
- **Mesolimbic Dopamine System** — Brain reward pathway affected by dominance and social rank.  
- **Neocortex** — The expanded brain region associated with social complexity and cognition, especially in primates.  
- **Neuroticism** — Personality trait linked to emotional reactivity and health outcomes in hierarchical contexts.  
- **Obedience** — Compliance with authority, ranging from superficial agreement to deep internalization.  
- **Overall Stress Response** — Variation in stress hormone levels and health effects dependent on rank meaning and social context.  
- **Pecking Order** — Hierarchical system primarily maintained by dominance displays rather than frequent fights.  
- **Political Orientation** — Stable set of ideological beliefs that tend to be consistent across different issues.  
- **Prefrontal Cortex (PFC)** — Brain region critical for impulse control, social intelligence, and dominance navigation.  
- **Social Dominance Orientation (SDO)** — Individual preference for hierarchy, power, and prestige.  
- **Social Brain Hypothesis** — Theory linking brain size expansion with increased social group complexity.  
- **Social Identity Theory** — Concept that a person’s identity is heavily influenced by group memberships.  
- **Social-Dominance Hierarchies** — Systems where individuals are ranked and gain different levels of access and power.  
- **Status Cues** — Physical and behavioral signals indicating rank, including facial expressions and body posture.  
- **System Justification** — Psychological process of defending and rationalizing existing social hierarchies.  
- **Theory of Mind** — Cognitive capacity to understand others’ thoughts, intentions, and feelings.  
- **Visceral Disgust** — Emotional response mediated by the insula, influencing moral and social judgments.

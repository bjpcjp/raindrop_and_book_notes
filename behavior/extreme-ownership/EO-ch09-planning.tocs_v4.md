- **Lessons in Mission Planning**
  - **Initial Challenges with Military Planning**
    - Early experience showed planning was overly complex and PowerPoint heavy.
    - The standard OPORD format was designed for 96-hour cycles, often impractical.
    - Initial briefs prioritized impressing superiors rather than clarity for troops.
    - Excessive detail distracted from essential mission understanding.
  - **Refinement of Planning Process**

    - Simplified presentations, maps, and interactive briefings improved comprehension.
    - Junior leaders were empowered to develop detailed plans to own their tasks.
    - Senior leaders maintained high-level oversight to catch gaps and improve strategy.
  - **Post-Operational Debriefing**
    - Conducted after every mission to analyze what worked and what did not.
    - Focused on continual improvement and updating standard operating procedures.
    - Debriefs improved team effectiveness and operational safety.

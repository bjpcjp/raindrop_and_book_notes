This volume presents a new English translation of Marcus Aurelius Antoninus's *The Meditations*, based primarily on Gataker’s Greek edition and Latin version, with detailed notes and an account of the emperor’s life compiled by Francis Hutcheson and James Moor. Emphasizing Marcus’s Stoic philosophy of benevolence, piety, and resignation to divine providence, the work reflects its significant influence on Enlightenment thought while critically engaging with Christian doctrine and contemporary theological controversies.

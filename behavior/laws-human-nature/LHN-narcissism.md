The Narcissistic Spectrum

We must be honest about our own nature and not deny it. We are all narcissists.

We need to develop our own empathy; to do this we need to develop 4 skills:

**The empathetic attitude: you must begin with the assumption you are ignorant. Learn to be**
curious about other peopleâ€™s point of view.

**Visceral empathy: pay attention to moods, as indicated by body language and tone of voice.**
Mirroring people will also help draw out an empathetic response.

**Analytic empathy: gather as much information about the early years of the people you are**
studying and their relationship to their parents and siblings.

**The empathetic skill: to work on this skill, keep several things in mind: The more people you**
interact with in the flesh, the better you will get at this. And the greater the variety of people
you meet, the more versatile your skill will become.

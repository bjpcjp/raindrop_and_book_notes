  - **Four Signs of Shortsightedness and Strategies to Overcome Them**
    - **Unintended Consequences**
      - Reactive solutions often ignore complex chains of cause and effect.
      - Belief in good intentions guaranteeing good outcomes ignores complex motivations.
      - Consequential thinking includes forecasting multiple reaction layers and potential fallout.
      - Large organizations benefit from designated skeptics to game out consequences.
      - See [The Cobra Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cobra_effect) for unintended consequences examples.
    - **Tactical Hell**

      - Ego-driven battles lack progress and elevate frustration and pettiness.
      - Detachment and reassessing priorities enable strategic responses or disengagement.
      - Strategic thinking leads to long-term success, not reactive defensive postures.
      - Study [The Art of War by Sun Tzu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Art_of_War) for strategic principles.

      - Addiction to real-time news cycles fosters impatience and diminished attention span.
      - Instantaneous data distort perception of larger, slower-moving trends.

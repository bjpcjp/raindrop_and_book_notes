Human nature tends to focus on immediate events, leading to shortsightedness that causes overreactions and poor long-term decision-making, but by cultivating patience, detachment, and a farsighted perspective, individuals can rise above present distractions to better anticipate consequences and align actions with enduring goals. This expanded awareness of time transforms anxiety into strategic clarity, enabling a deeper connection to one’s identity, wiser choices, and greater resilience amid life’s challenges.

Embracing a conscious awareness of our mortality transforms our experience of life by fostering purpose, empathy, and freedom, enabling us to face adversity with acceptance and deepen our connection to others. This philosophy encourages meditating on death to overcome fear and denial, thereby intensifying our appreciation of lifeâ€™s brevity, diversity, and the sublime mystery that lies beyond human understanding.

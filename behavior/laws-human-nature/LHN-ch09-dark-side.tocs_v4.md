- **The Law of Repression**  
  - People commonly repress a dark, shadow side consisting of insecurities and aggressive impulses.  
  - This Shadow leaks out in baffling or harmful behavior and must be recognized early.  
  - Integrating the Shadow enhances authenticity and channels unconscious creative energy.  
  - For deeper understanding, see [Carl Jung and the Shadow](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/jungian-psychology/shadow).  

- **Keys to Human Nature**  
  - Most people appear pleasant and responsible but occasionally reveal contradictory behavior.  
  - The Shadow consists of qualities people repress unconsciously and often surfaces under stress or with age.  
  - Key signs of the Shadow include contradictory behavior, emotional outbursts, vehement denial, "accidental" behavior, overidealization, and projection.  
  - Acting as a detective helps anticipate Shadow behavior by observing these signs.

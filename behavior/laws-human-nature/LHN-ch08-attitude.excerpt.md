Our attitudes shape our personal realities and strongly influence our experiences, interactions, and responses to adversity; by cultivating a positive, expansive attitude, we open ourselves to growth, learning, and improved relationships, whereas negative attitudes narrow our perspective and foster self-sabotage. Understanding and consciously altering our mindset is essential to changing our circumstances and unlocking our potential.

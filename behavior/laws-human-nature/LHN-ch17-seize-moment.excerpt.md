Generations shape our values, perspectives, and actions more profoundly than we often realize, creating a collective spirit or zeitgeist that influences history and societal change through a cyclical pattern of revolution and reaction. By deeply understanding and actively engaging with our generational identity and its tensions with others, we can transcend generational myopia, harness the spirit of the times, and contribute to shaping both the present and future.

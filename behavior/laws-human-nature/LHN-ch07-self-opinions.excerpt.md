People naturally resist influence because it threatens their self-opinion, which centers on autonomy, intelligence, and moral goodness; therefore, the most effective way to soften resistance is to confirm and validate these aspects, making people feel they are acting of their own free will. Mastering influence requires empathy, strategic listening, mood setting, and using people’s insecurities and resistance to create rapport and openness, while also maintaining flexibility in one’s own mind.

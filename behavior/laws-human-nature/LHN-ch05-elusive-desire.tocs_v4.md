  - **Strategies for Stimulating Desire**
    - Know how and when to withdraw to create mystery and increase value.
    - Create rivalries of desire by signaling others' interest to amplify one's own desirability.
    - Use induction by associating objects with illicit or transgressive elements to exploit repressed desires.
    - Employ ambiguity and open-ended presentations to engage imagination.
    - For practical tactics, see [Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influence:_The_Psychology_of_Persuasion).
  - **The Supreme Desire**
    - Awareness of one's covetous tendencies allows differentiation between productive restlessness and futile boredom.
    - Covetous desires provide motivation but must be consciously controlled to avoid wasteful pursuit.
    - Acceptance and deeper connection to reality and one's environment provide calmness and practical power.
    - Constantly chasing illusions leads away from fulfillment; focus and engagement with one's real world is advised.

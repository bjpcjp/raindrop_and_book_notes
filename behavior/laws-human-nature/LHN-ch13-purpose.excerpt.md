A strong sense of purpose, rooted in our unique inclinations and cultivated through persistent effort despite obstacles, provides essential direction and fulfillment in life, counteracting aimlessness, insecurity, anxiety, and depression. Avoiding false purposes such as the pursuit of pleasure, money, attention, or cynicism, individuals should discover and deepen their true calling to achieve meaningful progress and well-being.

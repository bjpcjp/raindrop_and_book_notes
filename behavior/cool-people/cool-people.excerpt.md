This research investigates the distinguishing attributes of cool people compared to good people across 13 diverse cultural regions, finding that cool individuals are more extraverted, hedonistic, powerful, adventurous, open, and autonomous, while good people are more conforming, traditional, secure, warm, agreeable, universalistic, conscientious, and calm. The study reveals that these attributes associated with coolness are remarkably consistent worldwide, suggesting that the concept of coolness serves as a stable social construct that influences status hierarchies and cultural innovation globally.

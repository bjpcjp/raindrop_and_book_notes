- **The Specific Affect Coding System (SPAFF)**
  - **History of the SPAFF**
    - The SPAFF was introduced in 1989 by Gottman and Krokoff for systematic observation of affective behavior in marital conflict.
    - Early observational systems focused on discrete behavioral bits, whereas SPAFF codes affect at the construct level integrating voice, verbal content, and physical features.
    - Studies using SPAFF cover a broad variety of couples, including newlyweds, violent couples, same-sex couples, and parent-child interactions.

  - **Learning to Code Behavior: The Philosophy of the SPAFF**
    - SPAFF is built on the premise that emotions are expressed in diverse ways requiring integration beyond discrete cues.
    - Coders need personal histories of interpersonal affective communication to interpret subtle cues.
    - Successful coding involves synthesizing multiple indicators from voice, face, verbal content, and miscellaneous behaviors.
    - The SPAFF approach contrasts purely physical feature coding versus cultural informant decoding.
  - **SPAFF Codes Are Latent Psychological Constructs**
    - SPAFF codes represent latent constructs inferred from multiple observable indicators rather than directly observable behaviors.
    - Indicators inform about the presence of a construct, while counterindicators suggest its absence.
    - The construct-validation model is essential to interpret discrete behaviors like the "eye roll" as contempt.
  - **Physical Features and Cultural Informants**
    - Physical features approaches code discrete and observable behaviors, which can be automated by machines.
    - Cultural informants decode behaviors based on contextual and cultural knowledge, identifying meaning beyond physical features.
    - SPAFF utilizes both approaches, emphasizing the need for human coders with interpersonal experience for accurate interpretation.
  - **Learning to Observe: Rules of People Watching**
    - Rule 1 states any given behavior can be a choice from multiple possible alternatives reflecting different interpersonal styles.
    - Rule 2 emphasizes interpreting behavior as if designed to portray a character, prompting analysis of intent.
    - Rule 3 recommends mimicking observed behavior to better grasp subtle emotional communication cues.
    - These rules facilitate active observation needed for reliable SPAFF coding.
  - **Facial Expressions of the SPAFF**
    - SPAFF integrates key Facial Action Coding System (FACS) units to identify upper and lower face muscle movements related to affect codes.
    - The system simplifies and modifies FACS coding by focusing on presence/absence of action units, rather than intensity levels.
    - Commonly coded AUs include inner and outer brow raisers, lip corner pullers, cheek raisers, and lip depressors.
    - See [FACS manual](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facial_Action_Coding_System) for detailed action unit descriptions.
  - **Codes of the SPAFF**
    - The SPAFF comprises positive affect codes (e.g., Affection, Enthusiasm, Humor, Interest, Validation) and negative affect codes (e.g., Anger, Belligerence, Contempt, Criticism).
    - Each code is defined by its function, verbal and nonverbal indicators, physical cues (often specific FACS AUs), and counterindicators.
    - Examples include Anger characterized by facial tightening and vocal growling, and Affection characterized by caring statements and positive voice tones.
    - The full code list and descriptions appear in Table 16.1.
  - **Data Collection and Reliability Assessment**
    - High quality audiovisual recordings with split-screen views and proper microphone placement enhance SPAFF coding accuracy.
    - Coding reliability is assessed using statistical measures such as Cohen’s kappa, with 1-second time units and typical 3-second windows for agreement.
    - Reliability checking involves double coding each tape and conducting regular coder meetings for clarifications.
    - Software like the Long Video Coding System (VCS) facilitates coding and disagreement identification.
  - **The Future of the SPAFF**
    - Researchers have developed weighting schemes transforming SPAFF codes into continuous scales predictive of relationship outcomes.
    - SPAFF is being expanded to code behavioral sequences over longer periods, such as rejection of influence during conflict.
    - Ongoing development includes frequent coder training, refinement of codes, and extending SPAFF’s use beyond couples to family and therapy contexts.
  - **Training**
    - SPAFF training involves learning constructs, mastering relevant FACS codes, and extensive practice viewing and discussing videotaped interactions.
    - Training often progresses in steps: people watching and construct understanding, FACS training, then SPAFF code learning.
    - Group training sessions and ongoing coder meetings enhance reliability and clarify coding ambiguities.
    - Active discussion of video examples is essential for solidifying coding competence.

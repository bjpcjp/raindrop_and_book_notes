The Specific Affect Coding System (SPAFF), developed by Gottman and Krokoff in 1989, is a systematic method for coding affective behavior in interpersonal interactions, especially marital conflict, integrating discrete behavioral cues into broader affective constructs. It combines verbal content, facial expressions (informed by FACS), vocal tone, and body language to identify latent psychological constructs such as Affection, Anger, Contempt, and Validation, and has been widely used and validated across various populations and contexts.

- **Action Units (AUs)** — Discrete facial muscle movements coded in the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) that form the basis of facial expression analysis in SPAFF.
- **Affection** — A SPAFF code expressing genuine caring and concern, facilitating closeness and bonding.
- **Anger** — Affective behavior indicating displeasure or perceived violation of autonomy and respect.
- **Belligerence** — Provocative behavior seeking to irritate or enrage the partner, often involving taunting or interpersonal challenges.
- **Chronbach’s Alpha** — A reliability statistic used to assess internal consistency or agreement in SPAFF coding.
- **Confusion Matrix** — A tabular display of agreements and disagreements between coders used to calculate reliability such as Cohen’s kappa.
- **Contempt** — Behavior aimed at belittling, hurting, or humiliating a partner by communicating superiority or disrespect.
- **Continuous Scale (SPAFF)** — A weighted scoring system translating SPAFF codes into a continuous scale from negative to positive valence.
- **Cronbach’s Alpha** — A measure of internal consistency (reliability) used in coding assessments.
- **Defensiveness** — A SPAFF code indicating deflection of blame or responsibility, often involving counterattacks or excuses.
- **Domineering** — Attempts to assert control over a partner or conversation through invalidation, lecturing, or manipulation.
- **Disgust** — An involuntary response to noxious or morally objectionable stimuli, involving distinctive facial expressions.

- **Facial Action Coding System (FACS)** — A detailed system for coding facial muscle movements used as the foundation for SPAFF facial coding.
- **Fear/Tension** — Affective signs of anxiety, worry, or nervous anticipation characterized by speech disturbances and fidgeting.
- **Humor** — Shared amusement characterized by mutual laughter, wit, private jokes, or playful teasing.
- **Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC)** — A reliability metric assessing agreement for continuous ratings in SPAFF coding.
- **Interest** — Positive engagement and information-seeking behavior toward one’s partner, often involving questions and nonverbal attention.
- **Latent Variables** — Unobserved psychological constructs inferred from multiple observable indicators in SPAFF coding.
- **Neutral** — A SPAFF code representing nonaffective, informational exchanges with relaxed voice and facial expression.
- **Paralinguistic Cues** — Vocal elements such as pitch, tone, and rhythm which convey affective meaning in SPAFF coding.
- **Physical Cues** — Observable bodily or facial movements that serve as indicators of specific SPAFF affective codes.
- **Specific Affect Coding System (SPAFF)** — A coding system designed to categorize affective behavior during interpersonal interactions.
- **Stonewalling** — Active withdrawal behavior communicating unwillingness to listen or respond, characterized by nonresponsive body language.
- **Threats** — Hostile domineering behaviors using explicit conditions and punitive consequences to control a partner.
- **Validation** — Behavior conveying sincere understanding and acceptance of a partner’s feelings or opinions.
- **Whining** — A plaintive, high-pitched vocal protest that communicates victimhood or emotional pleading.
- **Weighting Scheme** — Assigning numerical weights to SPAFF codes based on their predictive relationships to positive or negative relationship outcomes.

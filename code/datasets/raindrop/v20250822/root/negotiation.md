Negotiating effectively means proving that you’re a collaborator, not an
adversary. To do that, you need to demonstrate that you’re attuned to
your counterpart’s logic, emotions, and perspective. These strategies
can help. Use short, simple vocal prompts. For example: “And?” “Really?”

</div>

People, including negotiators, lie every day, so when you’re trying to
make a deal, it’s important to defend against deception. The best
strategy, says the author, is to focus not on detecting lies but on
preventing them. She outlines five tactics that research has shown to be
effective: Encourage reciprocity. You can build trust and prompt other
parties to disclose strategic information by sharing information
yourself. Ask the right questions. Negotiators often lie by omission,
keeping mum about relevant facts, but if directly asked, they are more
likely to respond honestly. Watch for dodging. Don’t let your
counterparts sidestep your questions—write them down in advance, take
notes on the answers, and make sure you get the information you’re
seeking. Don’t dwell on confidentiality. Studies show that the more you
reassure others that you’ll protect their privacy, the more guarded and
apt to lie they become. So be nonchalant when discussing sensitive
topics. Cultivate leaks. People often reveal information unwittingly, so
listen carefully for any slips and try indirect approaches to gaining
information.

Three very different case studies — involving hostages in Afghanistan, a
suicidal man in Calgary, and a tug-of-war between Brazilian and French
businessmen — point to the importance of face, or reputation, in
negotiations. To help you and your negotiating partners succeed, it is
important to recognize why face matters, map out all the players
involved in a negotiation, ask yourself if the solution being proposed
will cause a loss of face for anyone, and work to help avoid that.

The technique has been used by a wide variety of researchers in the market research industry. The PSM approach has been a staple technique for addressing pricing issues for the past 20 years. It historically has been promoted by many professional market research associations in their training and professional development programs. The PSM approach continues to be used widely throughout the market research industry and descriptions can be easily found in many market research websites.</p>

    <p class="card-excerpt">At most small and medium-sized e-commerce retailers, prices are typically set and updated in an ad hoc fashion without one clear owner. The process often starts by using a gross margin target, followed by some comparison with competitors, and then some adjustments from there. Many of these retailers would quickly admit that this isn‚Äôt an optimal strategy, and that they are likely leaving money on the table ‚Äî and they‚Äôre often right. The authors‚Äô experience with price testing has shown that there is actually a significant amount of money left on the table when pricing is left un-optimized.</p>

These datasets, rich in visual and textual information, are fundamental to developing algorithms capable of understanding and interpreting images. They serve as the backbone for enhancing machine learning models, particularly those tasked with deciphering the complex interplay between visual elements in images and their corresponding textual descriptions. A significant challenge in this field is the need for large-scale, accurately annotated datasets. These are essential for training models but are often not publicly accessible, limiting the scope of research and development. The ImageNet and OpenImages datasets, containing human-annotated</p>

    <p class="card-excerpt">Planning poker, also called Scrum poker, is a consensus-based, gamified technique for estimating, mostly used for timeboxing in Agile principles. In planning poker, members of the group make estimates by playing numbered cards face-down to the table, instead of speaking them aloud. The cards are revealed, and the estimates are then discussed. By hiding the figures in this way, the group can avoid the cognitive bias of anchoring, where the first number spoken aloud sets a precedent for subsequent estimates.</p>

For e-commerce retailers without physical stores, catalogs can effectively mimic stores‚Äô sensory experiences to enhance customer affinity. For multichannel retailers, by understanding the channel preferences of current customers through transactional data, multichannel retailers can add an effective catalog marketing channel to their store and e-commerce channel strategies.</p>

    <p class="card-excerpt">For an aspiring product manager (PM), there are three primary considerations when evaluating the role: core competencies, emotional intelligence (EQ), and company fit. The best PMs have mastered the core competencies, have a high EQ, and work for the right company for them. The last requires thinking about the level of technical skill the company requires, its philosophy of the PM role, the stage of the company, and the relationship you‚Äôll have with senior management.</p>

    <p class="card-excerpt">What consumers truly value can be difficult to pin down and psychologically complicated. But universal building blocks of value do exist, creating opportunities for companies to improve their performance in existing markets or break into new markets. In the right combinations, the authors‚Äô analysis shows, those elements will pay off in stronger customer loyalty, greater consumer willingness to try a particular brand, and sustained revenue growth. Three decades of experience doing consumer research and observation for corporate clients led the authors‚Äîall with Bain & Company‚Äîto identify 30 ‚Äúelements of value.‚Äù Their model traces its conceptual roots to Abraham Maslow‚Äôs ‚Äúhierarchy of needs‚Äù and extends his insights by focusing on people as consumers: describing their behavior around products and services. They arrange the elements in a pyramid according to four kinds of needs, with ‚Äúfunctional‚Äù at the bottom, followed by ‚Äúemotional,‚Äù ‚Äúlife changing,‚Äù and then ‚Äúsocial impact‚Äù at the peak. The authors provide real-world examples to demonstrate how companies have used the elements to grow revenue, refine product design to better meet customers‚Äô needs, identify where customers perceive strengths and weaknesses, and cross-sell services.</p>

    <p class="card-excerpt">A technology advantage isn‚Äôt enough to build an enduring enterprise SaaS company because at the core, all SaaS software share the same architecture. A relational database stores data and a web site presents the data. This is true for CRM (Salesforce), marketing automation (Marketo), email (Exchange), content management systems (Sharepoint) and so on. Because SaaS apps use standard databases, engineers can easily transfer the data from one database to another. I‚Äôm greatly simplifying here because differences in architecture may exist, but in principle it‚Äôs simple to extract, transform and load data from one relational database into another.</p>

    <p class="card-excerpt">Since Benchmark‚Äôs investment in Ebay 15 years ago, we have been fascinated by online marketplaces.

For example, my car tax check is an online platfrom that allows you to book a slot for a complete history and guidance of your car taxes and other details. The arrival of the smartphone amplifies these opportunities, as the Internet‚Äôs connective tissue now extends deeper and deeper into an industry with the participants connected‚Ä¶</p>

At first blush, that might seem a reasonable and effective solution, it is prone to wild inaccuracy. Absolute pricing judgments are hard without reference points. For example: How much would you be willing to pay for a new iPhone? It‚Äôs a very challenging question to answer in the abstract.</p>

I am an Uber investor and board member, and therefore expect that many will dismiss these thoughts as naked bias.

    <p class="card-excerpt">Why do companies routinely succumb to the lure of rebranding? The answer, say A.G. Lafley and Roger L. Martin, the authors of ‚ÄúCustomer Loyalty Is Overrated,‚Äù is rooted in serious misperceptions about the nature of competitive advantage‚Äînamely, that companies need to continually update their business models, strategies, and communications to respond to the explosion of options that sophisticated consumers face. Research suggests that what makes competitive advantage truly sustainable is helping consumers avoid having to make a choice. They choose the leading product in the market primarily because that is the easiest thing to do. And each time they select it, its advantage increases over that of the products or services they didn‚Äôt choose, creating what the authors call cumulative advantage. Lafley and Martin offer guidance for building cumulative advantage: Become popular early. Back in 1946, Procter & Gamble gave away a box of Tide with every washing machine sold in America. Design for habit. When P&G introduced Febreze, consumers liked it but didn‚Äôt use it much. The problem, it turned out, was that the product came in what looked like a glass-cleaner bottle, so users kept it under the sink. When the company redesigned the bottle so that customers would keep it in a more visible spot, they ended up using it more often. Innovate inside the brand. Efforts to ‚Äúrelaunch‚Äù brands can lead people to break their habits. Changes in product features should be introduced in a way that retains cumulative advantage. For customers, ‚Äúimproved‚Äù is much more comfortable than ‚Äúnew.‚Äù Keep communication simple. A clever ad may win awards, but if its message is too complex, it will backfire.</p>

    <p class="card-excerpt">In many ways, online marketplaces are the perfect business model. Since they facilitate transactions between independent suppliers and customers rather than take possession of and responsibility for the products or services in question, they have inherently low cost structures and fat gross margins. They are highly defensible once established, owing to network effects. Yet online marketplaces remain extremely difficult to build, say Andrei Hagiu of Harvard Business School and venture capitalist Simon Rothman of Greylock Partners. Most entrepreneurs and investors attribute this to the challenge of quickly attracting a critical mass of buyers and suppliers. But it is wrong to assume that once a marketplace has overcome this hurdle, the sailing will be smooth. Several other important pitfalls can threaten marketplaces: growing too fast too early; failing to foster sufficient trust and safety; resorting to sticks, rather than carrots, to deter user disintermediation; and ignoring the risks of regulation. This article draws on company examples such as eBay, Lending Club, and Airbnb to offer practical advice for avoiding those hazards.</p>

Other techniques, like incentivized referral, improve the economics but still tally 19 month payback periods.

Many MSPs are more valuable than companies in the same industries that provide only products or services: For instance, Airbnb is now worth more than Marriott, the world‚Äôs largest hotel chain. However, companies that weren‚Äôt born as platform businesses rarely realize that they can‚Äîat least partially‚Äîturn their offerings into one, say the authors. And even if they do realize it, they often wander in the dark searching for a strategy to achieve this transformation. In this article, Hagiu and Altman provide a framework for doing so. They lay out four specific ways in which products and services can be turned into platforms and examine the strategic advantages and pitfalls of each: (1) opening the door to third parties; (2) connecting customers; (3) connecting products to connect customers; and (4) becoming a supplier to a multisided platform. These ideas can be used by physical as well as online businesses.</p>

    <p class="card-excerpt">The ability to get issues on the table and work through them constructively is critical to having a healthy culture. Managers can normalize productive conflict on your team by using an exercise to map out the unique value of each role and the tensions that should exist among them. Draw a circle and divide that circle into enough wedges to represent each role on your team. For each role, ask: What is the unique value of this role on this team? On which stakeholders is this role focused? What is the most common tension this role puts on team discussions? Answer those questions for each member of the team, filling in the wedges with the answers. As you go, emphasize how the different roles are supposed to be in tension with one another. With heightened awareness and a shared language, your team will start to realize that much of what they have been interpreting as interpersonal friction has actually been perfectly healthy role-based tension.</p>

    <p class="card-excerpt">‚ÄòThe Problem with‚Ä¶‚Äô series covers controversial topics related to efforts to improve healthcare quality, including widely recommended but deceptively difficult strategies for improvement and pervasive problems that seem to resist solution.  The ‚Äò5 whys‚Äô technique is one of the most widely taught approaches to root-cause analysis (RCA) in healthcare. Its use is promoted by the WHO,1 the English National Health Service,2 the Institute for Healthcare Improvement,3 the Joint Commission4 and many other organisations in the field of healthcare quality and safety. Like most such tools, though, its popularity is not the result of any evidence that it is effective.5‚Äì8 Instead, it probably owes its place in the curriculum and practice of RCA to a combination of pedigree, simplicity and pedagogy.  In terms of pedigree, ‚Äò5 whys‚Äô traces its roots back to the Toyota Production System (TPS).9 It also plays a key role in Lean10 (a generic version of TPS) as well as Six Sigma,11 another popular quality improvement (QI) methodology. Taiichi Ohno describes ‚Äò5 whys‚Äô as central to the TPS methodology:The basis of Toyota's scientific approach is to ask why five times whenever we find a problem ‚Ä¶ By repeating why five times, the nature of the problem as well as its solution becomes clear. The solution, or the how-to, is designated as ‚Äò1H.‚Äô Thus, ‚ÄòFive whys equal one how‚Äô (5W=1H). (ref. 9, p. 123)  This quote also makes the case for the technique's simplicity. Asking ‚Äòwhy‚Äô five times allows users to arrive at a single root cause that might not have been obvious at the outset. It may also inspire a single solution to address that root cause (though it is not clear that the ‚Äò1H‚Äô side of the equation has been adopted as widely).  The pedagogical argument for ‚Ä¶</p>

Parody accounts are commonplace -- to a fault if you ask some -- and there have been more than one fiasco involving users who pretend to be different people with different accounts; it's crazy.

    <p class="card-excerpt">Dyson almost launched a robot vacuum. Back in 2001, after three years in development. Its first effort, shown to the British public in London looked nothing (and we mean nothing) like the eventual 360 Eye unveiled today. Sixteen years is a long time in tech. The DC06, as it was called, never made it past home-trial stages in 2012 -- apparently too pricey and heavy. Between then and now, technology got better. A lot better. At the Tokyo launch of its new robot vacuum, Sir James Dyson himself, told us how it all came together, and why it's not his native UK, but Japan, that'll get to buy it first.</p>

    <p class="card-excerpt">Editor's note: Victor Belfor is the vice president of business development at Influitive. He recently started angel investing and mentoring at 500 startups.  As products mature, companies continue to compete in heated battles with their competitors by adding more features and more functionality. However, a lot of customers would prefer fewer features because extra features tend to make products clunky and difficult to use. Still, companies become feature-producing machines.</p>

    <p class="card-excerpt">Editor's Note: The following is a guest post by Simon Rothman of Greylock Partners. Rothman is particularly passionate about Marketplace technology (Etsy, Kickstarter, Airbnb, etc) and how to garner success in that category.  Marketplaces are endemic to the consumer web: Largely popularized by eBay, we've recently seen quite a few variations on the theme, like young guns Etsy, oDesk, Airbnb, and Kickstarter. Old or new, the two elements that bind all marketplaces are network effects (a good thing) and the chicken-and-egg problem (not such a good thing).</p>

    <p class="card-excerpt">Editor's note:¬†Roman Stanek is CEO and founder of GoodData.  Lately, in Silicon Valley and its counterparts around the world, disappointment has ruled the halls of companies that had a huge impact with consumers, but then fizzled as investments when they went public‚ÄîFacebook‚Äôs and Zynga‚Äôs IPOs being the most notorious examples. Attention quickly moved from the consumer to the enterprise market, where Splunk, Palo Alto Networks, Workday, and LinkedIn are all humming along just fine. Entrepreneurs seeking to sell to enterprise customers should recognize that the business-to-business (B2B) market, especially with respect to IT, plays by a different set of rules than the business-to-consumer (B2C) space.</p>

    <p class="card-excerpt">Andreessen Horowitz-backed music lyrics and annotations Rap Genius was the latest to stray over to the darker side of so-called "growth hacking," with its¬†spammy SEO tactics¬†disguised as an affiliate program. Called out, exposed and now¬†punished¬†by Google, the site's traffic has¬†tanked. But Rap Genius, thanks in part to that¬†$15 million investment, will probably recover. They'll clean up their links, make amends, and maybe even get back into Google's good graces. End users will once again land on Rap Genius's pages, many of them none the wiser for the time the site spent in the penalty box.  Other startups may not be as lucky.</p>

    <p class="card-excerpt">We‚Äôve all watched from the sidelines as companies have come out in a burst of glory, and then, two years later, spent their venture capital, lost their user base, and failed to monetize. This begs the question - what are the factors that drive a company‚Äôs survival, differentiate it, and ultimately make it a winner? In today‚Äôs online world, personalization is increasingly making or breaking companies. The companies that win are the ones making personalization a key company value ‚Äì not just a feature.  In the early days of the web, consumers were happy just to gain access to information. However, as technology became more sophisticated, and as more consumers and companies came online, we quickly moved out of the access age and into a state of information overload, often leaving consumers frustrated and confused. Companies that helped consumers cut through the clutter to reveal relevant information had a critical and sustainable competitive advantage in their respective areas. The concept of relevance is critical to the success of Google, for example.</p>

    <p class="card-excerpt">Competitive poaching refers to the practice of bidding on ads for a competitor‚Äôs search terms, in order to poach customers searching for that brand. It‚Äôs a common tactic in the world of digital ads ‚Äî but is it effective? The author shares results from the first-ever empirical study of this practice, which found that poaching can work well for higher-end brands, but may backfire for lower-end or mass market offerings. Specifically, the study found that when an ad poached customers who searched for a high-end brand, users clicked on it more, but when an ad poached a low-end or mass market target, users were less likely to click. Of course, the author notes that clickthrough rate is just one metric, and there may be other ways in which a poaching campaign could be harmful or beneficial. But these findings can help marketers add a bit of science to the art that is digital advertising, helping them to optimize campaigns for their unique products and customers.</p>

    <p class="card-excerpt">Retail has been constantly reinventing itself, and participants race to keep up with what feels like a series of epic shifts in consumer preferences. To get a clearer, more-complete picture, we studied the actual decisions made by 1,500 apparel and footwear shoppers in the United States. Our five most surprising findings: shopping is not yet truly omnichannel; when consumers buy online, they purchase more; online journeys take longer than in-store; brand stores and website generate higher spend than multibrand stores; and, very often, consumers just want to buy new versions of an item they already own.</p>

As we move into the third year of pandemic uncertainty, adopting three simple practices will help managers build more resilient ‚Äî and re-energized ‚Äî teams.</p>

    <p class="card-excerpt">Profit desert customers ‚Äî small, low-profit customers often numbering in the tens of thousands ‚Äî are an important business segment in most companies. They often amount to about 50‚Äì80% of customers and consume about 40‚Äì60% of the company‚Äôs costs. In some companies, they‚Äôre assigned to territory reps as low-revenue ‚ÄúC‚Äù accounts, which distracts the reps from selling more lucrative business. In all companies, they create costly complexity in functions ranging from order-taking to fulfilment to after-sales service and returns because these customers are numerous and often inexperienced. The best way to manage your profit desert customers is to cluster them under a unified management structure ‚Äî a profit desert customer team ‚Äî rather than having them scattered in sales reps‚Äô portfolios throughout the company. This team should be composed of specialized sales and marketing managers who are solely focused on this customer segment. The author presents three steps these managers should take to bring latent profits to the bottom line.</p>

The authors found that more customized responses ‚Äî perceived as promotional and thus viewed as disingenuous ‚Äî negatively affected future reviews. For negative reviews, it‚Äôs important to quickly respond to every one with a tailored solution to the specific complaint.</p>

    <p class="card-excerpt">Increasingly, companies are using experiments to guide them in their decision making‚Äîbut many are still missing opportunities, or are failing to implement experiments well. When it comes to the rollout of new products, one particularly effective new kind of experiment involves randomizing the introduction of new products across a set of markets. Uber used this strategy before rolling out its Express Pool service, and Airbnb did the same before rollout out a new landing-page design. In both cases, the companies gathered data that allowed them to roll out their products with confidence that they would succeed‚Äîas indeed they did. Many companies, even those not in the tech sector, can benefit from this kind of experimentation, especially if they follow a few basic guidelines.</p>

    <p class="card-excerpt">How does Netflix get away with releasing its movies in theaters on the same day it makes them available for ‚Äúfree‚Äù on its streaming platform? The answer is that Netflix is pursuing a fundamentally different business model from everyone else in the industry. Netflix is not in the business of selling individual movies to many different customers. Instead, it‚Äôs in the business of selling many different movies to individual customers‚Äîin bundles. Bundled subscriptions allow Netflix to practice a different kind of price discrimination from the movie studios. The company doesn‚Äôt have to figure out how much a consumer values any individual movie on the service. The bundle does that for them‚Äîvery profitably.</p>

    <p class="card-excerpt">When Hulu was launched, in 2008, it had the backing of three major motion-picture studios‚Äî21st Century Fox, NBC Universal, and Walt Disney Studios/ABC Television. The service seemed poised to dominate video distribution online‚Äîbut today it ranks only 8th among streaming services, far behind Netflix, YouTube, and Amazon Prime Video. What happened? From its inception, it turns out, the service faced two major obstacles to success: its ownership structure, which discouraged its members from sharing their most valuable content; and the organizational structure of its members, which focused on their traditional model of doing business, rather than on streaming. But streaming is the future of the entertainment industry, the authors write, and Hulu will only succeed if it acknowledges that truth and adapts its business model accordingly‚Äîwhich, promisingly, it has begun to do.</p>

    <p class="card-excerpt">Data is invading every nook and cranny of every team, department, and company in every industry, everywhere. Developing the talent needed to take full advantage must be a high priority. Indeed, everyone must be able to contribute to improving data quality, interpreting analyses, and conducting their own experiments. It will take decades for the public education systems to churn out enough people with the needed skills ‚Äî far too long for companies to wait. Fortunately, managers, aided by a senior data scientist engaged for a few hours a week can introduce five powerful ‚Äútools‚Äù that will help their teams start to use analytics to solve important business problems.</p>

    <p class="card-excerpt">The U.S. grocery industry has reached an uncertain crossroads, facing competition from many sources, but especially German discount stores ALDI and LIDL, who are aggressively expanding across the United States. Whether U.S. retailers will maintain their market share hinges on how they use private-label products (also called white-label goods or store brands) to fight back. In France, grocers were able to repel ALDI and LIDL by offering private-label goods that were both affordable and high quality, but in the UK, retailers chose to offer super-budget private-label items. They might have been cheap, but they were very low-quality, and consumers punished them. The U.S. doesn‚Äôt have a lot of experience with private-label goods, so American retailers will have to come up to speed quickly if they hope to maintain their advantage.</p>

    <p class="card-excerpt">Product expansion is often used as a path to growth, but it can have unintended consequences for other aspects of the business ‚Äî including the customer experience central to the company‚Äôs value proposition. Indeed, current trends are moving away from broad offerings in many industries. A recent poll had 64% of consumers saying they would pay more for a simpler, more convenient experience. The trick is, growth strategies have to fit the company‚Äôs current context, especially its brand promise and its target market. Once the company has a strategy to fit the context, it can sequence out the various steps to implement it. For example, McDonald‚Äôs had known for years that customers wanted all-day breakfast, but to be able to offer it, it first had to streamline and revamp its kitchens.</p>

    <p class="card-excerpt">Cost-plus pricing is a lot like the romance novel genre, in that it‚Äôs widely ridiculed yet tremendously popular.¬†The idea behind cost-plus pricing is straightforward. The seller calculates all costs, fixed and variable, that have been or will be incurred in manufacturing the product, and then applies a markup percentage to these costs to estimate the asking price. Though currently out of fashion among pricing experts (for good reason), there are sometimes strategic and pragmatic reasons¬†to¬†use cost-plus pricing.¬†When implemented with forethought and prudence, cost-plus pricing can lead to powerful differentiation, greater customer trust, reduced risk of price wars, and steady, predictable profits for the company.</p>

    <p class="card-excerpt">Rather than simply selling products, more and more companies have begun to sell projects, helping customers achieve a specific goal on a specific timeframe. For example, consider the evolution of medical device maker Philips. After more than a century of profitable existence, the company has become an intricate, blurred matrix organization. Accountabilities and responsibilities were shared between products, segments, countries, regions, functions, and headquarters. To simplify this convoluted and archaic organization structure, as well as protect its products against commoditization, Philips put projects at center stage. Shifting from selling products or experiences to selling projects requires fundamental shifts across your business ‚Äî but in a rapidly evolving industry, it can make your company more nimble and responsive to the market.</p>

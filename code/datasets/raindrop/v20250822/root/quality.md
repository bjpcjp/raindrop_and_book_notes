[Eight disciplines problem

</div>

Eight Disciplines Methodology (8D) is a method or model developed at
Ford Motor Company used to approach and to resolve problems, typically
employed by quality engineers or other professionals. Focused on product
and process improvement, its purpose is to identify, correct, and
eliminate recurring problems.\[1\] It establishes a permanent corrective
action based on statistical analysis of the problem and on the origin of
the problem by determining the root causes. Although it originally
comprised eight stages, or 'disciplines', it was later augmented by an
initial planning stage. 8D follows the logic of the PDCA cycle. The

[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/32/FMEA.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Failure_mode_and_effects_analysis)

</div>

Failure mode and effects analysis is the process of reviewing as many
components, assemblies, and subsystems as possible to identify potential
failure modes in a system and their causes and effects. For each
component, the failure modes and their resulting effects on the rest of
the system are recorded in a specific FMEA worksheet. There are numerous
variations of such worksheets. An FMEA can be a qualitative analysis,
but may be put on a quantitative basis when mathematical failure rate
models are combined with a statistical failure mode ratio database. It
was one of the first highly structured, systematic techniques for
failure analysis. It was developed by reliability engineers in the late
1950s to study problems that might arise from malfunctions of military
systems. An FMEA is often the first step of a system reliability study.

‚ÄòThe Problem with‚Ä¶‚Äô series covers controversial topics related to
efforts to improve healthcare quality, including widely recommended but
deceptively difficult strategies for improvement and pervasive problems
that seem to resist solution. The ‚Äò5 whys‚Äô technique is one of the most
widely taught approaches to root-cause analysis (RCA) in healthcare. Its
use is promoted by the WHO,1 the English National Health Service,2 the
Institute for Healthcare Improvement,3 the Joint Commission4 and many
other organisations in the field of healthcare quality and safety. Like
most such tools, though, its popularity is not the result of any
evidence that it is effective.5‚Äì8 Instead, it probably owes its place in
the curriculum and practice of RCA to a combination of pedigree,
simplicity and pedagogy. In terms of pedigree, ‚Äò5 whys‚Äô traces its roots
back to the Toyota Production System (TPS).9 It also plays a key role in
Lean10 (a generic version of TPS) as well as Six Sigma,11 another
popular quality improvement (QI) methodology. Taiichi Ohno describes ‚Äò5
whys‚Äô as central to the TPS methodology:The basis of Toyota's scientific
approach is to ask why five times whenever we find a problem ‚Ä¶ By
repeating why five times, the nature of the problem as well as its
solution becomes clear. The solution, or the how-to, is designated as
‚Äò1H.‚Äô Thus, ‚ÄòFive whys equal one how‚Äô (5W=1H). (ref. 9, p. 123) This
quote also makes the case for the technique's simplicity. Asking ‚Äòwhy‚Äô
five times allows users to arrive at a single root cause that might not
have been obvious at the outset. It may also inspire a single solution
to address that root cause (though it is not clear that the ‚Äò1H‚Äô side of
the equation has been adopted as widely). The pedagogical argument for ‚Ä¶

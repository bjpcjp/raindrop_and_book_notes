The Divine Comedy is an Italian narrative poem by Dante Alighieri, begun
c. 1308 and completed around 1321, shortly before the author's death. It
is widely considered the pre-eminent work in Italian literature and one
of the greatest works of Western literature. The poem's imaginative
vision of the afterlife is representative of the medieval worldview as
it existed in the Western Church by the 14th century. It helped
establish the Tuscan language, in which it is written, as the
standardized Italian language. It is divided into three parts: Inferno,
Purgatorio, and Paradiso.

The most consequential military engagement in Southeast Asia in the 20th
century is the 1954 Battle of Dien Bien Phu. It was fought ostensibly
between the French and the communist-led Vietmin at Dien Bien Phu, an
obscure valley bordering China, in the remote northwestern part of what
was then French Indochina. The battle ended with a humiliating defeat
for the French, which brought down the French government, ended French
colonial rule in Asia, ushered in America’s epic military involvement in
the region for decades to come, and fundamentally changed the global
geostrategic landscape.

</div>

A Veblen good is a type of luxury good, named after American economist
Thorstein Veblen, for which the demand increases as the price increases,
in apparent contradiction of the law of demand, resulting in an
upward-sloping demand curve. The higher prices of Veblen goods may make
them desirable as a status symbol in the practices of conspicuous
consumption and conspicuous leisure. A product may be a Veblen good
because it is a positional good, something few others can own.

To operate reliably, the US electrical grid needs to balance supply and
demand: to make sure, at any given moment, that the amount of
electricity demanded by homes, businesses, and factories is equal to the
amount being supplied by nuclear reactors, gas turbines, and other types
of power plants.

For most of the industry’s history, electric power in the US had largely
been provided by vertically integrated utility companies that handled
every part of the electricity supply: generating it, transmitting it,
distributing it to customers, and managing the overall system. Utilities
were granted monopoly status in their area of operations, and in return
had their rates regulated by state public utility commissions. Most
utility companies were private enterprises known as investor-owned
utilities (IOUs), though there were several other models, such as
municipally-owned utilities, rural co-ops, or the federal Tennessee
Valley Authority.

</div>

In a recent survey of 100 productivity hacks, timeboxing — migrating
to-do lists into calendars — was ranked the most useful. Timeboxing can
give you a much greater sense of control over your workday. You decide
what to do and when to do it, block out all distractions for that
timeboxed period, and get it done. The benefits of calendarized
timeboxing are many, varied, and highly impactful. The practice improves
how we feel (control), how much we achieve as individuals (personal
productivity), and how much we achieve in the teams we work in (enhanced
collaboration). This may be the single most important skill or practice
you can possibly develop as a modern professional, as it buys you so
much time to accomplish anything else. It’s also straightforwardly
applied and at no cost. Box some time to implement a version of this
that works for you.

amygdala, a part of the brain that controls strong emotional reactions,

expression in the amygdala of humans and non-human primates. The work
could lead to more targeted treatments for disorders such as anxiety
that affect tens of millions of people.

admire Kahneman a great deal. Not for his Nobel or for his work, which

Funnel optimization for web3 companies will become critical to their
success. Token grants cost 4-7x than traditional customer acquisition
techniques. Other techniques, like incentivized referral, improve the
economics but still tally 19 month payback periods. A year-and-a-half
might be fine for a SaaS company selling a \$50k to \$100k ARR product,
but long-term viability demands achieving 3-6 month paybacks of modern
web2 consumer companies. Why are the payback periods so high?

Non-fungible token (NFT) is a term used to describe a unique digital
asset whose ownership is tracked on a blockchain, such as Ethereum.
Assets that can be represented as NFTs range from digital goods, such as
items that exist within virtual worlds, to claims on physical assets
such as clothing items or real estate. In the coming years, we will see
NFTs used to unlock entirely new use cases that are only made possible
by crypto.

The inference method is crucial for NLP models in subword tokenization.
Methods like BPE, WordPiece, and UnigramLM offer distinct mappings, but
their performance differences must be better understood. Implementations
like Huggingface Tokenizers often need to be clearer or limit inference
choices, complicating compatibility with vocabulary learning algorithms.
Whether a matching inference method is necessary or optimal for
tokenizer vocabularies is uncertain. Previous research focused on
developing vocabulary construction algorithms such as BPE, WordPiece,
and UnigramLM, exploring optimal vocabulary size and multilingual
vocabularies. Some studies examined the effects of vocabularies on
downstream performance, information theory, and cognitive plausibility.

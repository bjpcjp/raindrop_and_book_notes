Wayfair has a huge catalog with over 14 million items. Our site features
a diverse array of products for people’s homes, with product categories
ranging from “appliances” to “décor and pillows” to “outdoor storage
sheds.” Some of these categories include hundreds of thousands of
products; this broad offering ensures that we have something for every
style and home. However, the large size of our product catalog also
makes it hard for customers to find the perfect item among all of the
possible options.

[Cookbook — Bayesian Modelling with

</div>

Recently I’ve started using PyMC3 for Bayesian modelling, and it’s an
amazing piece of software! The API only exposes as much of heavy
machinery of MCMC as you need — by which I mean, just the pm.sample()
method (a.k.a., as Thomas Wiecki puts it, the Magic Inference Button™).
This really frees up your mind to think about your data and model, which
is really the heart and soul of data science! That being said however, I
quickly realized that the water gets very deep very fast: I explored my
data set, specified a hierarchical model that made sense to me, hit the
Magic Inference Button™, and… uh, what now? I blinked at the angry red
warnings the sampler spat out.

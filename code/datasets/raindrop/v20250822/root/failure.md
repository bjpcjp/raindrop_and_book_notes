[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/32/FMEA.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Failure_mode_and_effects_analysis)

</div>

Failure mode and effects analysis is the process of reviewing as many
components, assemblies, and subsystems as possible to identify potential
failure modes in a system and their causes and effects. For each
component, the failure modes and their resulting effects on the rest of
the system are recorded in a specific FMEA worksheet. There are numerous
variations of such worksheets. An FMEA can be a qualitative analysis,
but may be put on a quantitative basis when mathematical failure rate
models are combined with a statistical failure mode ratio database. It
was one of the first highly structured, systematic techniques for
failure analysis. It was developed by reliability engineers in the late
1950s to study problems that might arise from malfunctions of military
systems. An FMEA is often the first step of a system reliability study.

[How to Overcome Your Fear of

</div>

People are quick to blame themselves for failure. But not doing
something because you’re afraid to get started isn’t going to help you
grow. Here are four strategies to help you get over the hump. Start by
redefining what failure means to you. If you define failure as the
discrepancy between what you hope to achieve (such as getting a job
offer) and what you might achieve (learning from the experience), you
can focus on what you learned, which helps you recalibrate for future
challenges. It’s also important to set approach goals instead of
avoidance goals: focus on what you want to achieve rather than what you
want to avoid. Creating a “fear list” can also help. This is a list of
what may not happen as a result of your fear — the cost of inaction. And
finally, focus on learning. The chips aren’t always going to fall where
you want them to — but if you expect that reality going into an event,
you can be prepared to wring the most value out of whatever outcome.

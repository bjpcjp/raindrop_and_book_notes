Deep learning architectures have revolutionized the field of artificial
intelligence, offering innovative solutions for complex problems across
various domains, including computer vision, natural language processing,
speech recognition, and generative models. This article explores some of
the most influential deep learning architectures: Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Generative
Adversarial Networks (GANs), Transformers, and Encoder-Decoder
architectures, highlighting their unique features, applications, and how
they compare against each other. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
CNNs are specialized deep neural networks for processing data with a
grid-like topology, such as images. A CNN automatically detects the
important features without any human supervision.

Treating anxiety, depression and other disorders may depend on the
amygdala, a part of the brain that controls strong emotional reactions,
especially fear. But a deep understanding of this structure has been
lacking. Now scientists at the University of California, Davis have

expression in the amygdala of humans and non-human primates. The work

book became the basis of an opera of the same name by Michael Nyman,
which premiered in 1986.

To recognise a chair or a dog, our brain separates objects into their
individual properties and then puts them back together. Until recently,
it has remained unclear what these properties are. Scientists at the Max
Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences in Leipzig have
now identified them - from "fluffy” to “valuable” - and found that all
it takes is 49 properties to recognise almost any object.

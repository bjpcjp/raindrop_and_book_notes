An auction is usually a process of buying and selling goods or services
by offering them up for bids, taking bids, and then selling the item to
the highest bidder or buying the item from the lowest bidder. Some
exceptions to this definition exist and are described in the section
about different types. The branch of economic theory dealing with
auction types and participants' behavior in auctions is called auction
theory.

</div>

A Vickrey–Clarke–Groves (VCG) auction is a type of sealed-bid auction of
multiple items. Bidders submit bids that report their valuations for the
items, without knowing the bids of the other bidders. The auction system
assigns the items in a socially optimal manner: it charges each
individual the harm they cause to other bidders. It gives bidders an
incentive to bid their true valuations, by ensuring that the optimal
strategy for each bidder is to bid their true valuations of the items;
it can be undermined by bidder collusion and in particular in some
circumstances by a single bidder making multiple bids under different
names. It is a generalization of a Vickrey auction for multiple items.

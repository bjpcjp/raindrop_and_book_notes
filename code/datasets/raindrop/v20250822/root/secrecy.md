Advertisers often depict their products being consumed in a social
setting, but increasingly they also depict people secretly consuming
their products. Will consumers like a product more if they are prompted
to consume it in secret? New research explores this question, finding
that prompting women to think about consuming products in secret has an
impact, not only on product evaluations, but also on behavior and
willingness to pay for those products. The authors refer to this effect
as the “secrecy effect.”

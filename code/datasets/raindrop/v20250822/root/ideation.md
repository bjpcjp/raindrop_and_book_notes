</div>

Most crowdsourcing initiatives end up with an overwhelming amount of
useless ideas. Dealing with a full submission box is not only extremely
time consuming and costly, it also biases how ideas are selected: When
firms receive too many ideas, they tend to focus on ideas that are
already familiar to them, defeating the entire purpose of crowdsourcing,
which is to surface new thinking. Why do many crowdsourced ideas turn
out so bad, and what can firms do about it? Recent research finds that
it comes down to understanding the motivations of crowd members.

intensely on a problem, then let your mind wander. I’ve enjoyed doing
this when problem solving and learning, and recently I’ve been thinking
about how weird it is to build trust in your unconscious to do the work
for you, especially when it comes to technical work. Letting your mind
focus and letting your mind wander The first recommendation I have for
anyone taking a meta look at learning is Barbara Oakley’s Learning How

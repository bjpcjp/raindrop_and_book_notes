[Military Drone Swarms and the Options to Combat Them \| Small Wars
Journal](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/military-drone-swarms-and-options-combat-them)

</div>

The tactical use of drones is expanding as demonstrated from the past
100 years. Drones were first created in the U.S. and United Kingdom
during World War I, though neither country employed them during the war.
In World War II, the Nazis created the V-1 to serve as a missile. The
U.S. employed drones for surveillance missions during the Vietnam War
and utilized them frequently for counter-insurgency surveillance and
strikes in Iraq and Afghanistan. Drones are now developed in and
utilized by over 100 countries and non-state actors. Drone capabilities,
manufacturers, and customers will likely continue increasing and a
tactical shift in utilizing drone swarms is emerging. This article
provides a broad overview on the current state of drones for commercial
and military use, the impact drone swarms can play in the military
environment, and the options available to combat swarms.

The most consequential military engagement in Southeast Asia in the 20th
century is the 1954 Battle of Dien Bien Phu. It was fought ostensibly
between the French and the communist-led Vietmin at Dien Bien Phu, an
obscure valley bordering China, in the remote northwestern part of what
was then French Indochina. The battle ended with a humiliating defeat
for the French, which brought down the French government, ended French
colonial rule in Asia, ushered in America’s epic military involvement in
the region for decades to come, and fundamentally changed the global
geostrategic landscape.

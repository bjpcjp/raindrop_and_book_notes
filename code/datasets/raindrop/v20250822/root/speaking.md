When you have to communicate a difficult organizational decision to
employees, it’s hard to know how much information to provide when you
can’t be fully transparent yet. Saying nothing can undermine people’s
trust in your motives and compassion, whereas saying too much can leave
people feeling overwhelmed and vulnerable as they struggle to process
the information and implications. Striking the right balance between
these two extremes is a tricky exercise for leaders. The author presents
five strategies to help you figure out what to say and do when you can’t
yet be fully transparent with your employees.

What does it take to become a more convincing communicator? New research
suggests that linguistic mirroring — that is, adjusting your
communication style to match that of your audience — is an effective
tool to increase your ability to influence others. In this piece, the
authors describe four key dimensions of linguistic mirroring, as well as
several tactical strategies for leaders looking to win over a client,
judge, or other important evaluator. Ultimately, they argue that
building genuine relationships with key evaluators is the best way to
gain insight into their linguistic preferences — but it’s up to all of
us to make sure that we use the power of linguistic mirroring for good.

</div>

It’s important to understand that when you, as a leader, communicate
with your team, using weaker words weakens your message and blunts your
ability to inspire people. It’s not enough to just throw thoughts out
there and hope for the best. You need to actively recommend ideas and
assert their worthiness in all of your communications. For example,
consider these “power words”: “I’m proposing (not “sharing”) an idea
that will make our process more efficient.” “I’m suggesting (not
“sharing”) a new logo that better conveys our brand message.” “I’m
recommending (not “sharing”) a campaign to make our workplace more
diverse.” Ultimately, audiences respond more actively to big points than
to small words, but thoughtful leaders need to assess both, knowing that
the more powerfully they come across — even in small ways — the greater
impact they have on the people they hope to inspire.

[4 Ways to Communicate with More

</div>

The pandemic and other stressful events over the past few years have
only made empathic communications even more desirable and necessary,
especially as those expressions have become more virtual — including
videos, social media posts, and emails. But just as each of us has
varying levels of empathy, not every leader is equally empathic. So is a
lack of natural empathy a showstopper when it comes to expressing and
benefitting from empathic communications? No. The good news is that all
leaders (even those who are not naturally empathic) can communicate
messages of empathy as powerfully as they convey messages of unity and
accountability. During challenging times, the most effective leadership
communications are ones that deliver attention, acknowledge distress,
demonstrate care, and — not necessarily at first, but eventually — take
appropriate action to mitigate the situation or at least provide
comfort. This article offers four touchpoints to focus on in your
communications.

We may have learned that we need to let people speak without
interrupting but taking turns talking does not truly denote listening.
And unintentionally hijacking conversations to advise, inject humor,
empathize, prioritize efficiency, or insert ourselves into the speaker’s
narrative is often done with good intentions, but may instead disrupt
the human connection we think we’re forging. Recognizing when to shift
out of our habitual styles and consciously apply alternative styles of
listening and responding may allow for more effective and meaningful
interactions.

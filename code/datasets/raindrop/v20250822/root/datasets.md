Dataset distillation is an innovative approach that addresses the
challenges posed by the ever-growing size of datasets in machine
learning. This technique focuses on creating a compact, synthetic
dataset that encapsulates the essential information of a larger dataset,
enabling efficient and effective model training. Despite its promise,
the intricacies of how distilled data retains its utility and
information content have yet to be fully understood. Let’s delve into
the fundamental aspects of dataset distillation, exploring its
mechanisms, advantages, and limitations. Dataset distillation aims to
overcome the limitations of large datasets by generating a smaller,

Computer vision has advanced significantly in recent decades, thanks in
large part to comprehensive benchmark datasets like COCO. However,
nearly a decade after its introduction, COCO's suitability as a
benchmark for modern AI models is being questioned. Its annotations may
contain biases and nuances reflecting the early stages of computer
vision research. With model performance plateauing on COCO, there are
concerns about overfitting to the dataset's specific characteristics,
potentially limiting real-world applicability. To modernize COCO
segmentation, researchers have proposed COCONut - a novel, large-scale
universal segmentation dataset in this paper. Unlike previous attempts
at creating large datasets that often compromised

Human motion capture has emerged as a key tool in various industries,
including sports, medical, and character animation for the entertainment
sector. Motion capture is utilized in sports for multiple purposes,
including injury prevention, injury analysis, video game industry
animations, and even generating informative visualization for TV
broadcasters. Traditional motion capture systems provide solid results
in the majority of circumstances. Still, they are expensive and
time-consuming to set up, calibrate, and post-process, making them
difficult to utilize on a broad scale. These concerns are made worse for
aquatic activities like swimming, which bring up unique problems such as
marker reflections

Large-scale pre-trained Vision and language models have demonstrated
remarkable performance in numerous applications, allowing for the
replacement of a fixed set of supported classes with zero-shot open
vocabulary reasoning over (nearly arbitrary) natural language queries.
However, recent research has revealed a fundamental flaw in these
models. For instance, their inability to comprehend Visual Language
Concepts (VLC) that extend 'beyond nouns,' such as the meaning of
non-object words (e.g., attributes, actions, relations, states, etc.),
or their difficulty with compositional reasoning, such as comprehending
the significance of the word order in a sentence. Vision and language

</div>

MedMNIST v2 is a large-scale MNIST-like collection of standardized
biomedical images, including 12 datasets for 2D and 6 datasets for 3D.
All images are pre-processed into 28 x 28 (2D) or 28 x 28 x 28 (3D) with
the corresponding classification labels, so that no background knowledge
is required for users. Covering primary data modalities in biomedical
images, MedMNIST v2 is designed to perform classification on lightweight
2D and 3D images with various data scales (from 100 to 100,000) and
diverse tasks (binary/multi-class, ordinal regression and multi-label).
The resulting dataset, consisting of 708,069 2D images and 10,214 3D
images in total, could support numerous research / educational purposes
in biomedical image analysis, computer vision and machine learning.
Description and image from: MedMNIST v2: A Large-Scale Lightweight
Benchmark for 2D and 3D Biomedical Image Classification Each subset
keeps the same license as that of the source dataset. Please also cite

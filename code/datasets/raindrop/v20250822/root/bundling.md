How does Netflix get away with releasing its movies in theaters on the
same day it makes them available for “free” on its streaming platform?
The answer is that Netflix is pursuing a fundamentally different
business model from everyone else in the industry. Netflix is not in the
business of selling individual movies to many different customers.
Instead, it’s in the business of selling many different movies to
individual customers—in bundles. Bundled subscriptions allow Netflix to
practice a different kind of price discrimination from the movie
studios. The company doesn’t have to figure out how much a consumer
values any individual movie on the service. The bundle does that for
them—very profitably.

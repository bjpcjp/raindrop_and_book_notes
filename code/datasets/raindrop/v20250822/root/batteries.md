The Japan Atomic Energy Agency reported earlier this year that is has
developed and tested a battery with depleted uranium as the active
material of the negative electrode. Why would they do this, and what
role could such a battery play? First let's look at the details (which
are sparse). The battery uses depleted uranium

To operate reliably, the US electrical grid needs to balance supply and
demand: to make sure, at any given moment, that the amount of
electricity demanded by homes, businesses, and factories is equal to the
amount being supplied by nuclear reactors, gas turbines, and other types
of power plants.

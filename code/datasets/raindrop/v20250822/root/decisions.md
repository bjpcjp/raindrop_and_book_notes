Most innovation managers know that few of their initiatives will
succeed, so they keep multiple projects running at the same time and
create processes for quickly separating winners from losers. One popular
way to make decisions about what stays and what goes is the use of stage
gates. Yet, even with stage gates, firms struggle to kill bad projects.
The authors undertook a decade-long review of the product development
portfolio at former handset maker Sony Ericsson. They found that that
the conventional use of stage gates can actually be part of the problem,
impeding project discontinuation in counterintuitive ways.

Decision tables are easy, simple, and powerful. You can teach them in
five minutes and write one in half that time. You can look at a table
and understand what it’s saying, see if it matches your problem, and
check for design flaws. So it’s kinda weird that there’s basically
nothing about them online. I wrote an introduction a while back, but I
want something a little more formal. So this post will reintroduce the
core ideas in a more formal way and then talk about some of the

Dr. Daniel Kahneman features on the latest Farnam Street podcast and
it’s a surprising episode. Kahneman wrote Thinking Fast and Slow. I
admire Kahneman a great deal. Not for his Nobel or for his work, which
are both impressive, but for his humility. Some of the key tenets of
Kahneman’s work in his famous book were disproved. And he owned up to
it, both in print and on the podcast. That’s the hallmark of someone
with great integrity, and it’s a sign to trust someone more.

Organizations are awash in data — from geocoded transactional data to
real-time website traffic to semantic quantifications of corporate
annual reports. All these data and data sources only add value if put to
use. And that typically means that the data is incorporated into a
model. The most sophisticated organizations — from Alphabet to Berkshire
Hathaway to the CIA — all use models. In fact, they do something even
better: they use many models in combination. But creating an “ensemble”
of models isn’t just about picking the ones that perform best on their
own. You want to combine models that complement one another. Three rules
can help you construct your own powerful ensemble of models: spread
attention broadly, boost predictions, and seek conflict.

[How to Decide With Speed and Conviction by
@ttunguz](http://tomtunguz.com/decisiveness)

A startup’s competitive advantage is execution speed. That quickness
stems from a CEO’s ability to decide and this ability separates the
great from the good. According to a recently published Harvard Business
Review article, one of the four key behaviors distinguishing exceptional
CEOs is deciding with speed and conviction. \[We\] discovered that
high-performing CEOs do not necessarily stand out for making great
decisions all the time; rather, they stand out for being more decisive.

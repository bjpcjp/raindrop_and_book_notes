[Managing the
“Invisibles”](https://hbr.org/2014/05/managing-the-invisibles)

</div>

Reprint: R1405G Even in an age of relentless self-promotion, some
extremely capable professionals prefer to avoid the spotlight.
“Invisibles” work in fields ranging from engineering to interpreting to
perfumery, but they have three things in common: They are ambivalent
about recognition, seeing any time spent courting fame as time taken
away from the work at hand. They are meticulous. And they savor
responsibility, viewing even high pressure as an honor and a source of
fascination. Something else unites Invisibles: They represent a
management challenge. The usual carrots don’t motivate them; however,
managers can take several steps to ensure their satisfaction. Leaders
should recognize who their Invisibles are; decide if they want more
Invisibles on the team; reward them fairly, soliciting reports on their
accomplishments; make the work more intrinisically interesting; and talk
to the Invisibles about what works best for them. These actions are well
worth taking, as Invisibles not only bring exceptional levels of
achievement to an organization but quietly improve the work of those
around them, elevating performance and tone across the board.

</div>

It’s important to understand that when you, as a leader, communicate
with your team, using weaker words weakens your message and blunts your
ability to inspire people. It’s not enough to just throw thoughts out
there and hope for the best. You need to actively recommend ideas and
assert their worthiness in all of your communications. For example,
consider these “power words”: “I’m proposing (not “sharing”) an idea
that will make our process more efficient.” “I’m suggesting (not
“sharing”) a new logo that better conveys our brand message.” “I’m
recommending (not “sharing”) a campaign to make our workplace more
diverse.” Ultimately, audiences respond more actively to big points than
to small words, but thoughtful leaders need to assess both, knowing that
the more powerfully they come across — even in small ways — the greater
impact they have on the people they hope to inspire.

One question that has long plagued organizations is how to create
high-performing front lines — without unexpected consequences. The
solution may be simple: Focus on motivating frontline workers. An
experiment with a national retail organization found that transforming
the operating model of some stores, to boost the motivation of their
employees, raised productivity, customer satisfaction, and sales. The
key was to get rid of motivational tactics that created emotional and
economic pressure on employees, and instead build systems to encourage
learning and a sense of play and purpose in the work.

A slide deck revealing the plans (and expectations) for next-generation
High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) technology was published by Korea Advanced
Institute of Science and Technology and TERA (Terabyte Interconnection
and Package Laboratory). Starting with HBM4. This will be the go-to
standard for next-gen data centers and AI GPUs that are launching in
2026. Both AMD and NVIDIA have confirmed the use of HBM for their MI400
and Rubin offerings. Next-gen memory will continue to scale in stacked
layers, but each layer will become thinner. HBM thickness is expected
not to exceed 720 micrometers, with HBM5 targeting 36µm per DRAM die.
Given the increase in power consumption, KAIST and TERA expect that HBM5
(100W) and HBM6 (120W) will already require immersion cooling, while
HBM7 (160W) and HBM8 (180W) could feature embedded cooling solutions.
With the arrival of glass-based silicon interposers, the research firm
highlights the use of embedded cooling as the standard approach, which
will go through the interposer and offer direct-cooling to the HBM, HBF,
and GPU IPs. Read more by Wccftech: https://lnkd.in/d--5qUwx \#HBM

The Future of AI Accelerators: A Roadmap of Industry Leaders The AI
hardware race is heating up, with major players like NVIDIA, AMD, Intel,
Google, Amazon, and more unveiling their upcoming AI accelerators.
Here’s a quick breakdown of the latest trends: Key Takeaways: NVIDIA
Dominance: NVIDIA continues to lead with a robust roadmap, extending
from H100 to future Rubin and Rubin Ultra chips with HBM4 memory by
2026-2027. AMD’s Competitive Push: AMD’s MI300 series is already
competing, with MI350 and future MI400 models on the horizon. Intel’s AI
Ambitions: Gaudi accelerators are growing, with Falcon Shores on track
for a major memory upgrade. Google & Amazon’s Custom Chips: Google’s TPU
lineup expands rapidly, while Amazon’s Trainium & Inferentia gain
traction. Microsoft & Meta’s AI Expansion: Both companies are pushing
their AI chip strategies with Maia and MTIA projects, respectively.
Broadcom & ByteDance Join the Race: New challengers are emerging,
signaling increased competition in AI hardware. What This Means: With
the growing demand for AI and LLMs, companies are racing to deliver
high-performance AI accelerators with advanced HBM (High Bandwidth
Memory) configurations. The next few years will be crucial in shaping
the AI infrastructure landscape. \$NVDA \$AMD \$INTC \$GOOGL \$AMZN

Large Language Models (LLMs) have become a cornerstone of artificial
intelligence, driving advancements in natural language processing and
decision-making tasks. However, their extensive power demands, resulting
from high computational overhead and frequent external memory access,
significantly hinder their scalability and deployment, especially in
energy-constrained environments such as edge devices. This escalates the
cost of operation while also limiting accessibility to these LLMs, which
therefore calls for energy-efficient approaches designed to handle
billion-parameter models. Current approaches to reduce the computational
and memory needs of LLMs are based either on general-purpose processors
or on GPUs, with a combination of weight quantization and

the industry standard 5nm CMOS technology node. Thermal characterization
shows that for a 165K change in temperature, the Sub-threshold Slope
(SS) and threshold voltage vary by 69 % and ~70 mV, respectively. At
room temperature, a single gate contacted n-FinFET RF device exhibits a
cutoff and maximum oscillation frequency of ~100 GHz and ~170 GHz,
respectively. Analog and RF Figures of Merit (FoMs) for 5 nm technology
at a device level and their temperature sensitivity are also reported.
The industry standard BSIM-CMG model is modified to capture the impact
of self-heating (SH) and parasitics. The SH model is based on measured
data, and the modeling approach renders it independent of other model
parameters. To the authors’ knowledge, an iteration free approach to
develop a model-card for RF applications is explained for the very first
time. Excellent agreement between the measured data and the model
indicates that our methodology is accurate and can be used for faster
PDK development.

In semiconductor design, “sign-off” during the tape-out (tapeout) of a
chip refers to the formal approval process to ensure that the chip
design is error-free, meets all specifications, and is ready for
manufacturing at the foundry. It is essential because it minimizes the
risk of costly errors, ensures compliance with foundry requirements, and
validates that

</div>

Presented by Robert Beachler, VP of Product, Untether AI. Traditional
processor architectures are failing to keep up with the exploding
compute demands of AI workloads. They are limited by the power-hungry
weight-fetch of von Neumann architectures and limitations of transistor
and frequency scaling. At-memory computation places compute elements
directly in the memory array, providing reduced power consumption and
increased throughput due to the massive parallelism and bandwidth
provided by the architecture. This presentation introduces a new class
of non-von Neumann compute designed to meet these AI demands. The Linley
Fall Processor Conference featured technical presentations addressing
processors and IP cores for AI applications, embedded, data center,
automotive, and communications. Session topic included AI in Edge
Devices, Vector-Processing Cores, Advancing Cloud AI, The New
Infrastructure Edge, Heterogenous Computing, SoC Design, In-Memory
Compute, and Security. Proceedings from the event are available for

This is a list of semiconductor fabrication plants. A semiconductor
fabrication plant is where integrated circuits (ICs), also known as
microchips, are manufactured. They are either operated by Integrated
Device Manufacturers (IDMs) that design and manufacture ICs in-house and
may also manufacture designs from design-only (fabless firms), or by
pure play foundries that manufacture designs from fabless companies and
do not design their own ICs. Some pure play foundries like TSMC offer IC
design services, and others, like Samsung, design and manufacture ICs
for customers, while also designing, manufacturing and selling their own
ICs.

Natural Language Processing (NLP) has rapidly evolved in the last few
years, with transformers emerging as a game-changing innovation. Yet,
there are still notable challenges when using NLP tools to develop
applications for tasks like semantic search, question answering, or
document embedding. One key issue has been the need for models that not
only perform well but also work efficiently on a range of devices,
especially those with limited computational resources, such as CPUs.
Models tend to require substantial processing power to yield high
accuracy, and this trade-off often leaves developers choosing between
performance and practicality. Additionally, deploying large models

I built a magical meme search engine using siglip/CLIP and vector
encoding images. It was a fun way to learn about this powerful
technology. I'm sharing the code so you can build your own and discover
forgotten gems in your photo library. Let's unleash the power of AI on
our images!

My hope is for you to see that Make is an automation/orchestration tool
that can be used in place of other modern build tools, and will help to
strengthen your understanding and ability to use the terminal/shell
environment (which is a big plus in my opinion, and helps open up many
avenues of technical progression). Whole books have been written on the
topic of Make and writing Makefiles so Mark will leave it up to you to
investigate further beyond this post if he manages to kindle your
interest.

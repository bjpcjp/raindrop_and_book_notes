</div>

This Redux tutorial series will show you the schematics of a Redux
application. Redux is AWESOME, but it takes a bit to get it setup. There
really aren't a lot of moving parts, but there are a lot of ways that
you can configure it - namely - configure the store. Redux is like Flux
in several ways, but it's different as well. It has these pieces: -
Provider: wraps your application, injecting the store - Store: one large
store that contains the state for your entire application - Reducers:
reducers listen to actions and make changes on the store values. They
also cannot mutate the data on the store in any way, but must return a
new set of data. - Actions: pretty much just like flux actions, the only
difference is that async can be handled in multiple different ways
depending on store "middleware" - Components: React components can be
injected with various pieces of store data. React components also
trigger Redux actions. This is what makes it all come together.

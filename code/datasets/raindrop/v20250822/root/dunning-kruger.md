Dunning–Kruger Effect explains why the least competent at a task often
incorrectly rate themselves as high-performers because they do not know
otherwise.

The Dunning-Kruger effect can be observed during talent shows like
American Idol. The auditions are usually filled with a variety of good
and bad singers. The ones who are bad at it, almost never realize how
bad they really are. Low ability people do not possess the skills needed
to recognize their own incompetence or lack of knowledge. Their poor
self-awareness leads them to overestimate their own capabilities.
However when you become more knowledgeable about a certain topic, that
confidence falls. Only when you start to reach above average skill, is
when the your confidence about a certain topic starts to pick up again.
But why? Why does being less skilled make you more confident in your
abilities? Images © Piers Baker www.svgdoodlewhiteboard.com

Bonhoeffer's "theory of stupidity" posits that we have more to fear from
stupidity than evil. The latter is easier to defeat than the former.

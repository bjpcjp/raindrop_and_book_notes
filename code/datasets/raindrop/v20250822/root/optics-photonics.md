[X-pSRAM: A Photonic SRAM with Embedded XOR Logic for
Ultra-Fast...](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22707)

Traditional von Neumann architectures suffer from fundamental
bottlenecks due to continuous data movement between memory and
processing units, a challenge that worsens with technology scaling as
electrical interconnect delays become more significant. These
limitations impede the performance and energy efficiency required for
modern data-intensive applications. In contrast, photonic in-memory
computing presents a promising alternative by harnessing the advantages
of light, enabling ultra-fast data propagation without length-dependent
impedance, thereby significantly reducing computational latency and
energy consumption. This work proposes a novel differential photonic
static random access memory (pSRAM) bitcell that facilitates
electro-optic data storage while enabling ultra-fast in-memory Boolean
XOR computation. By employing cross-coupled microring resonators and
differential photodiodes, the XOR-augmented pSRAM (X-pSRAM) bitcell
achieves at least 10 GHz read, write, and compute operations entirely in
the optical domain. Additionally, wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM)
enables n-bit XOR computation in a single-shot operation, supporting
massively parallel processing and enhanced computational efficiency.
Validated on GlobalFoundries' 45SPCLO node, the X-pSRAM consumed 13.2 fJ
energy per bit for XOR computation, representing a significant
advancement toward next-generation optical computing with applications
in cryptography, hyperdimensional computing, and neural networks.

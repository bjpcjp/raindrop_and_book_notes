A lot has happened this month, especially with the releases of new
flagship models like GPT-4.5 and Llama 4. But you might have noticed
that reactions to these releases were relatively muted. Why? One reason
could be that GPT-4.5 and Llama 4 remain conventional models, which
means they were trained without explicit reinforcement learning for
reasoning. However, OpenAI's recent release of the o3 reasoning model
demonstrates there is still considerable room for improvement when
investing compute strategically, specifically via reinforcement learning
methods tailored for reasoning tasks. While reasoning alone isn't a
silver bullet, it reliably improves model accuracy and problem-solving
capabilities on challenging tasks (so far). And I expect
reasoning-focused post-training to become standard practice in future
LLM pipelines. So, in this article, let's explore the latest
developments in reasoning via reinforcement learning.

</div>

Reinforcement learning (RL) is a fascinating field of AI focused on
training agents to make decisions by interacting with an environment and
learning from rewards and penalties. RL differs from supervised learning
because it involves doing rather than learning from a static dataset.
Let’s delve into the core principles of RL and explore its applications
in game playing, robot control, and resource management. Principles of
Reinforcement Learning Agent and Environment: In RL, the agent is the
learner or decision-maker interacting with the environment. The
environment provides context to the agent, affecting its decisions and
providing feedback through rewards or penalties.

Consider a problem where you are working on a machine learning
classification problem. You get an accuracy of 98% and you are very
happy. But that happiness doesn’t last long when you look at the
confusion matrix and realize that majority class is 98% of the total
data and all examples are classified as majority… Read More »Handling

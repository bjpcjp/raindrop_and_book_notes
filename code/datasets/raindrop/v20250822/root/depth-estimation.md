\*\*Monocular Depth Estimation\*\* is the task of estimating the depth
value (distance relative to the camera) of each pixel given a single
(monocular) RGB image. This challenging task is a key prerequisite for
determining scene understanding for applications such as 3D scene
reconstruction, autonomous driving, and AR. State-of-the-art methods
usually fall into one of two categories: designing a complex network
that is powerful enough to directly regress the depth map, or splitting
the input into bins or windows to reduce computational complexity. The
most popular benchmarks are the KITTI and NYUv2 datasets. Models are
typically evaluated using RMSE or absolute relative error. Source:

\*\*Depth Estimation\*\* is the task of measuring the distance of each
pixel relative to the camera. Depth is extracted from either monocular
(single) or stereo (multiple views of a scene) images. Traditional
methods use multi-view geometry to find the relationship between the
images. Newer methods can directly estimate depth by minimizing the
regression loss, or by learning to generate a novel view from a
sequence. The most popular benchmarks are KITTI and NYUv2. Models are
typically evaluated according to a RMS metric. Source: \[DIODE: A Dense

‘The Problem with…’ series covers controversial topics related to
efforts to improve healthcare quality, including widely recommended but
deceptively difficult strategies for improvement and pervasive problems
that seem to resist solution. The ‘5 whys’ technique is one of the most
widely taught approaches to root-cause analysis (RCA) in healthcare. Its
use is promoted by the WHO,1 the English National Health Service,2 the
Institute for Healthcare Improvement,3 the Joint Commission4 and many
other organisations in the field of healthcare quality and safety. Like
most such tools, though, its popularity is not the result of any
evidence that it is effective.5–8 Instead, it probably owes its place in
the curriculum and practice of RCA to a combination of pedigree,
simplicity and pedagogy. In terms of pedigree, ‘5 whys’ traces its roots
back to the Toyota Production System (TPS).9 It also plays a key role in
Lean10 (a generic version of TPS) as well as Six Sigma,11 another
popular quality improvement (QI) methodology. Taiichi Ohno describes ‘5
whys’ as central to the TPS methodology:The basis of Toyota's scientific
approach is to ask why five times whenever we find a problem … By
repeating why five times, the nature of the problem as well as its
solution becomes clear. The solution, or the how-to, is designated as
‘1H.’ Thus, ‘Five whys equal one how’ (5W=1H). (ref. 9, p. 123) This
quote also makes the case for the technique's simplicity. Asking ‘why’
five times allows users to arrive at a single root cause that might not
have been obvious at the outset. It may also inspire a single solution
to address that root cause (though it is not clear that the ‘1H’ side of
the equation has been adopted as widely). The pedagogical argument for …

The most pertinent question one can ask of a current or future employee
may just be: How do you learn? Lifelong learning is now roundly
considered to be an economic imperative, and job candidates or employees
who consider, update, and improve their skills will be the high
performers, especially over the longer term. Pressing ourselves on the
question of how we learn brings a hard, pragmatic edge to the important
but nebulous notion of growth mindset. The world and the workplace have
changed considerably in the past year. The skills we need to function
and flourish have correspondingly changed, and so we need to bring them
into a smarter, sharper focus to know what they are and to seek them out
proactively, persistently, and methodically.

</div>

Judgment—the ability to combine personal qualities with relevant
knowledge and experience to form opinions and make decisions—is “the
core of exemplary leadership,” according to Noel Tichy and Warren Bennis
(the authors of Judgment: How Winning Leaders Make Great Calls). It is
what enables a sound choice in the absence of clear-cut, relevant data
or an obvious path. Likierman believes that a more precise understanding
of what exactly gives someone good judgment may make it possible for
people to learn and improve on it. He approached CEOs at a range of
companies, from some of the world’s largest right down to start-ups,
along with leaders in the professions: senior partners at law and
accountancy firms, generals, doctors, scientists, priests, and
diplomats. He asked them to share their observations of their own and
other people’s exercise of judgment so that he could identify the skills
and behaviors that collectively create the conditions for fresh insights
and enable decision makers to discern patterns that others miss. As a
result, he has identified six key elements that collectively constitute
good judgment: learning, trust, experience, detachment, options, and
delivery. He describes these elements and offers suggestions for
improvement in each one.

When we learn new things from grappling with problems, it is natural for
us to want to share those learnings with others, in hopes that they will
face similar challenges with less of a struggle. How do those
well-intended new ideas so often evolve into movements that seem to lose
their way, and at times do more harm than good? In the course of
observing and at times being involved in this phenomenon, I sought to
understand what I saw happening time and again. Almost a decade ago, I
arrived at an explanation that I named The Myth of Commoditized
Excellence. What follows are the steps that can lead down this
unfortunate path.

</div>

Management teams are responsible for making sense of complex questions.
Maybe it’s estimating how much a market will grow next year, or finding
the best strategy to beat a competitor. One popular approach for
navigating these questions is turning to the “wisdom of crowds” – asking
many people for their opinions and suggestions, and then combining them
to form the best overall decision. Evidence suggests that the
combination of multiple, independent judgments is often more accurate
than even an expert’s individual judgment. But new research identifies a
hidden cost to this approach. When someone has already formed an
opinion, they’re far less likely to be receptive to the opinions of
others – and this can lead to evaluating other people and their ideas
more negatively. Fortunately, this work also suggests a few ways to
minimize this cost.

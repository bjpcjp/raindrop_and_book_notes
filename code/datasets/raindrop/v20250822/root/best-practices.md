[The 3 Competitive Defenses of Enduring SaaS Companies by
@ttunguz](http://tomtunguz.com/saas-barriers-to-entry)

</div>

A technology advantage isn’t enough to build an enduring enterprise SaaS
company because at the core, all SaaS software share the same
architecture. A relational database stores data and a web site presents
the data. This is true for CRM (Salesforce), marketing automation
(Marketo), email (Exchange), content management systems (Sharepoint) and
so on. Because SaaS apps use standard databases, engineers can easily
transfer the data from one database to another. I’m greatly simplifying
here because differences in architecture may exist, but in principle
it’s simple to extract, transform and load data from one relational
database into another.

</div>

There have long been a few fundamental challenges associated with
business process management. But a relatively new and innovative
technology, process mining, has the capability to revitalize process
management in firms where it has lain fallow for years. One problem
involves the creation of “current state” processes — a description of
how a business process is being performed today. In business process
reengineering, organizations are primarily interested in an improved “to
be” process, so often they have little interest in exploring “as is,” or
how the process is currently performed. The other general problem with
process management is the lack of connections between business processes
and an organization’s enterprise information systems. Enter process
mining. Process mining software can help organizations easily capture
information from enterprise transaction systems and provides detailed —
and data-driven — information about how key processes are performing. It
creates event logs as work is done: an order is received, a product is
delivered, a payment is made. The logs make visible how
computer-mediated work is really happening, including who did it, how
long it takes, and how it departs from the average. Process analytics
create key performance indicators for the process, which enables a
company to focus on the priority steps to improve.

Editor's Note: The following is a guest post by Simon Rothman of
Greylock Partners. Rothman is particularly passionate about Marketplace
technology (Etsy, Kickstarter, Airbnb, etc) and how to garner success in
that category. Marketplaces are endemic to the consumer web: Largely
popularized by eBay, we've recently seen quite a few variations on the
theme, like young guns Etsy, oDesk, Airbnb, and Kickstarter. Old or new,
the two elements that bind all marketplaces are network effects (a good
thing) and the chicken-and-egg problem (not such a good thing).

New research reveals that how we perform work as a team contributes more
to resilience than external stressors. On resilient teams, individuals
feel responsible for energizing each other. This is in stark contrast to
teams who are challenged by frustrating ways of working and fractured
relationships. As we move into the third year of pandemic uncertainty,
adopting three simple practices will help managers build more resilient

In 2017, I went to Facebook on a sabbatical from my faculty position at
Yale. I created a team to build a storage system called Delos at the
bottom of the Facebook stack (think of it as Facebook’s version of
Chubby). We hit production with a 3-person team in less than a year; and
subsequently scaled the team to 30+ engineers spanning multiple
sub-teams. In the four years that I led the team (until Spring 2021), we
did not experience a single severe outage (nothing higher than a SEV3).
The Delos design is well-documented in two academic papers (in OSDI 2020
and SOSP 2021). Delos is currently replacing all uses of ZooKeeper at
Facebook.

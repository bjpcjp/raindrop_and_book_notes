On the 91st Martian day, or sol, of NASA’s Mars 2020 Perseverance rover
mission, the Ingenuity Mars Helicopter performed its sixth flight. The
flight was designed to expand the flight envelope and demonstrate
aerial-imaging capabilities by taking stereo images of a region of
interest to the west. Ingenuity was commanded to climb to an altitude of
33 feet (10 meters) before translating 492 feet (150 meters) to the
southwest at a ground speed of 9 mph (4 meters per second). At that
point, it was to translate 49 feet (15 meters) to the south while taking
images toward the west, then fly another 164 feet (50 meters) northeast
and land.

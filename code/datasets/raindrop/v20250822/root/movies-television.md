Steven Soderbergh was one of the earliest filmmakers to break out in
what's now called the 'Indiewood' movement of the nineteen-nineties. He
was early enough, in fact, to have done so in the eighties, with the

A decade before Airbnb persuaded homeowners to transform their homes
into hotels, Netflix convinced its users to turn theirs into mini
Netflix warehouses. Customers who held onto their DVDs for longer meant
fewer shipping costs for Netflix, and fewer DVDs for the company to
manage and store. Netflix tracked heavy users of its service — labeling
them internally as “pigs” — and secretly throttled their deliveries. It
didn’t matter if Netflix rented fewer DVDs than Blockbuster, because the
company would keep collecting its monthly fee. The difference between
Blockbuster and Netflix was this: Blockbuster punished customers for
being forgetful; Netflix rewarded them for being mindless.

Connections is a science education television series created, written,
and presented by British science historian James Burke. The series was
produced and directed by Mick Jackson of the BBC Science and Features
Department and first aired in 1978 (UK) and 1979 (US). It took an
interdisciplinary approach to the history of science and invention, and
demonstrated how various discoveries, scientific achievements, and
historical world events were built from one another successively in an
interconnected way to bring about particular aspects of modern
technology. The series was noted for Burke's crisp and enthusiastic
presentation, historical re-enactments, and intricate working models.

each time, thinking, eventually I’ll have a cake. That’s Balzac. That’s

Terrestrial television or over-the-air television (OTA) is a type of
television broadcasting in which the content is transmitted via radio
waves from the terrestrial (Earth-based) transmitter of a TV station to
a TV receiver having an antenna. The term terrestrial is more common in
Europe and Latin America, while in Canada and the United States it is
called over-the-air or simply broadcast. This type of TV broadcast is
distinguished from newer technologies, such as satellite television, in
which the signal is transmitted to the receiver from an overhead
satellite; cable television, in which the signal is carried to the
receiver through a cable; and Internet Protocol television, in which the
signal is received over an Internet stream or on a network utilizing the
Internet Protocol. Terrestrial television stations broadcast on
television channels with frequencies between about 52 and 600 MHz in the
VHF and UHF bands. Since radio waves in these bands travel by line of
sight, reception is generally limited by the visual horizon to distances
of 64–97 kilometres (40–60 mi), although under better conditions and
with tropospheric ducting, signals can sometimes be received hundreds of
kilometers distant.

When Hulu was launched, in 2008, it had the backing of three major
motion-picture studios—21st Century Fox, NBC Universal, and Walt Disney
Studios/ABC Television. The service seemed poised to dominate video
distribution online—but today it ranks only 8th among streaming
services, far behind Netflix, YouTube, and Amazon Prime Video. What
happened? From its inception, it turns out, the service faced two major
obstacles to success: its ownership structure, which discouraged its
members from sharing their most valuable content; and the organizational
structure of its members, which focused on their traditional model of
doing business, rather than on streaming. But streaming is the future of
the entertainment industry, the authors write, and Hulu will only
succeed if it acknowledges that truth and adapts its business model
accordingly—which, promisingly, it has begun to do.

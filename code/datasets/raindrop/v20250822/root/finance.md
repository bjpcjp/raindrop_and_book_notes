that Capital in the Twenty-First Century, the magnum opus of the French

the year--and maybe of the decade."--Paul Krugman, New York Times "The
book aims to revolutionize the way people think about the economic
history of the past two centuries. It may well manage the feat."--The
Economist "Piketty's Capital in the Twenty-First Century is an
intellectual tour de force, a triumph of economic history over the

economics profession in recent years."--Steven Pearlstein, Washington

scale and sweep it brings us back to the founders of political

30.65 146.32 The series of PDF reports SG&A Benchmarks is the source for
the above data. They serve as a convenient source of information for
professional managers seeking benchmark information on the Selling,
General & Administrative spending practices of major public corporations
within a specific industry sector. SG&A expenses are composed of all the
commercial expenses of operation incurred in the regular course of
business pertaining to the securing of operating income. Any portion of
these expenses that the company itself allocates to cost of goods sold
will not be included in SG&A. SG&A expense includes advertising expense,
commissions, engineering expense, marketing expense, selling expense
including salaries of the salesforce, employee benefit expenses,
software expense, administrative office expense and other expenses
related to sales but not included in cost of goods sold. Frequently SG&A
to Sales ratios are used to judge overhead or cost of sales. Since
different industries vary significantly in their practices of
classification of expenses considered to be reported within SG&A
expense, SG&A Benchmarks is produced for individual industry sectors.
SG&A spending practices may also vary with size and country so
information on annual sales and headquarters city is provided. The
industry sector summary displays median SG&A to Sales ratio by industry
to illustrate the range of values reported by firms within the industry.
The tables for each individual industry present SG&A as a percentage of
sales and the annual percentage growth rate in SG&A spending as well as
in sales for each company within the industry. Comparing the growth rate
of SG&A expenses and sales gives a snapshot of where the profitability
of the firm may be heading. The firms are presented in three groups as
defined by sales of less than \$100 million, sales between \$100 million
and \$1 billion, and sales of more than \$1 billion. Two sets of
industry tabulations are presented. Alphabetical order by company name
aids in locating a firm. Order by SG&A to Sales ratio showcases the
‘leaner and meaner’ firms in each industry. This report will benefit
anyone seeking competitive benchmark intelligence including: corporate
staff, financial analysts, investment professionals, lenders, M&A
advisors, appraisers and industry consultants. Click on the sector of

Some years ago, I was explaining to my manager that I was feeling a bit
bored, and they told me to learn how to read a Profit & Loss (P&L)
statement. At the time, that sounded suspiciously like, “Stop wasting my
time,” but operating in an executive role has shifted my perspective a
bit: this is actually a surprisingly useful thing to learn. The P&L
statement is a map of a company’s operation and is an effective tool for
pointing you towards the most pressing areas to dig in.

One of the big subjects of discussion in the banking industry earlier
this year was the publication of the Millennial Disruption Index,
stating that millennials view banks as irrelevant and placing
traditional retail banking at the highest risk of disruption compared to
other B2C industries. Accenture's Banking 2020 report confirms this and
draws a parallel to the challenges the telecom industry faced 20 years
ago and states that non-banks will take a third of incumbent banks

[Black–Scholes model -
Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black%E2%80%93Scholes_model)

</div>

The Black–Scholes /ˌblæk ˈʃoʊlz/\[1\] or Black–Scholes–Merton model is a
mathematical model for the dynamics of a financial market containing
derivative investment instruments. From the parabolic partial
differential equation in the model, known as the Black–Scholes equation,
one can deduce the Black–Scholes formula, which gives a theoretical
estimate of the price of European-style options and shows that the
option has a unique price given the risk of the security and its
expected return (instead replacing the security's expected return with
the risk-neutral rate). The equation and model are named after
economists Fischer Black and Myron Scholes. Robert C. Merton, who first
wrote an academic paper on the subject, is sometimes also credited.

Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are a powerful and versatile supervised
machine learning algorithm primarily used for classification and
regression tasks. They excel in high-dimensional spaces and are
particularly effective when dealing with complex datasets. The core
principle behind SVM is to identify the optimal hyperplane that
effectively separates data points into different classes while
maximizing the margin between them. SVMs have gained significant
popularity due to their ability to handle both linear and non-linear
classification problems. By employing kernel functions, SVMs can map
data into higher-dimensional feature spaces, capturing intricate
patterns and relationships that may not be apparent in the

Optimization problems are everywhere in daily life. What’s the fastest
route from one place to another? How do you calculate the optimal price
for a product? How should you plant crops, allocate resources, and
schedule surgeries? Optimization Algorithms introduces the AI algorithms
that can solve these complex and poorly-structured problems. In
Optimization Algorithms: AI techniques for design, planning, and control
problems you will learn: The core concepts of search and optimization
Deterministic and stochastic optimization techniques Graph search
algorithms Trajectory-based optimization algorithms Evolutionary
computing algorithms Swarm intelligence algorithms Machine learning
methods for search and optimization problems Efficient trade-offs
between search space exploration and exploitation State-of-the-art
Python libraries for search and optimization Inside this comprehensive
guide, you’ll find a wide range of optimization methods, from
deterministic search algorithms to stochastic derivative-free
metaheuristic algorithms and machine learning methods. Don’t
worry—there’s no complex mathematical notation. You’ll learn through
in-depth case studies that cut through academic complexity to
demonstrate how each algorithm works in the real world. Plus, get

</div>

For statistics and control theory, Kalman filtering, also known as
linear quadratic estimation, is an algorithm that uses a series of
measurements observed over time, including statistical noise and other
inaccuracies, and produces estimates of unknown variables that tend to
be more accurate than those based on a single measurement alone, by
estimating a joint probability distribution over the variables for each
timeframe. The filter is constructed as a mean squared error minimiser,
but an alternative derivation of the filter is also provided showing how
the filter relates to maximum likelihood statistics. The filter is named
after Rudolf E. Kálmán, who was one of the primary developers of its
theory.

model isn’t working well, then your floating-point format certainly
isn’t going to save you! However, past a certain point of model

Often, the input features for a predictive modeling task interact in
unexpected and often nonlinear ways. These interactions can be
identified and modeled by a learning algorithm. Another approach is to
engineer new features that expose these interactions and see if they
improve model performance. Additionally, transforms like raising input
variables to a power can help to better expose the…

In numerical analysis, the Kahan summation algorithm, also known as
compensated summation,\[1\] significantly reduces the numerical error in
the total obtained by adding a sequence of finite-precision
floating-point numbers, compared to the obvious approach. This is done
by keeping a separate running compensation (a variable to accumulate
small errors), in effect extending the precision of the sum by the
precision of the compensation variable.

[Jacobian matrix and determinant -
Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobian_matrix_and_determinant)

</div>

In vector calculus, the Jacobian matrix (/dʒəˈkoʊbiən/,\[1\]\[2\]\[3\]
/dʒɪ-, jɪ-/) of a vector-valued function of several variables is the
matrix of all its first-order partial derivatives. When this matrix is
square, that is, when the function takes the same number of variables as
input as the number of vector components of its output, its determinant
is referred to as the Jacobian determinant. Both the matrix and (if
applicable) the determinant are often referred to simply as the Jacobian
in literature.\[4\] They are named after Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi.

Last time we saw a geometric version of the algorithm to add points on
elliptic curves. We went quite deep into the formal setting for it
(projective space \$ \mathbb{P}^2\$), and we spent a lot of time talking
about the right way to define the “zero” object in our elliptic curve so
that our issues with vertical lines would disappear. With that
understanding in mind we now finally turn to code, and write classes for
curves and points and implement the addition algorithm.

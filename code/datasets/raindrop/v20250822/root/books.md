Guardian Best Book of the 21st CenturyWinner of the Financial Times and
McKinsey Business Book of the Year AwardWinner of the British Academy
MedalFinalist, National Book Critics Circle Award "It seems safe to say
that Capital in the Twenty-First Century, the magnum opus of the French
economist Thomas Piketty, will be the most important economics book of
the year--and maybe of the decade."--Paul Krugman, New York Times "The
book aims to revolutionize the way people think about the economic
history of the past two centuries. It may well manage the feat."--The
Economist "Piketty's Capital in the Twenty-First Century is an
intellectual tour de force, a triumph of economic history over the
theoretical, mathematical modeling that has come to dominate the
economics profession in recent years."--Steven Pearlstein, Washington
Post "Piketty has written an extraordinarily important book...In its
scale and sweep it brings us back to the founders of political
economy."--Martin Wolf, Financial Times "A sweeping account of rising
inequality...Piketty has written a book that nobody interested in a
defining issue of our era can afford to ignore."--John Cassidy, New
Yorker "Stands a fair chance of becoming the most influential work of
economics yet published in our young century. It is the most important
study of inequality in over fifty years."--Timothy Shenk, The Nation

</div>

The Divine Comedy is an Italian narrative poem by Dante Alighieri, begun
c. 1308 and completed around 1321, shortly before the author's death. It
is widely considered the pre-eminent work in Italian literature and one
of the greatest works of Western literature. The poem's imaginative
vision of the afterlife is representative of the medieval worldview as
it existed in the Western Church by the 14th century. It helped
establish the Tuscan language, in which it is written, as the
standardized Italian language. It is divided into three parts: Inferno,
Purgatorio, and Paradiso.

[Culture series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_series)

</div>

The Culture series is a science fiction series written by Scottish
author Iain M. Banks and released from 1987 until 2012. The stories
centre on The Culture, a utopian, post-scarcity space society of
humanoid aliens, and advanced superintelligent artificial intelligences
living in artificial habitats spread across the Milky Way galaxy. The
main themes of the series are the dilemmas that an idealistic,
more-advanced civilization faces in dealing with smaller, less-advanced
civilizations that do not share its ideals, and whose behaviour it
sometimes finds barbaric. In some of the stories, action takes place
mainly in non-Culture environments, and the leading characters are often
on the fringes of (or non-members of) the Culture, sometimes acting as
agents of Culture (knowing and unknowing) in its plans to civilize the
galaxy. Each novel is a self-contained story with new characters,
although reference is occasionally made to the events of previous
novels.

</div>

‚ÄúCan you recommend any books?‚Äù After being asked this question a
thousand times, I put together a private email list of book
recommendations. Each month, I send one email with 5 to 10 amazing books
that I read, reviewed and think you‚Äôll like. The email is simple and
quick and that‚Äôs why its grown to reach 300,000+ readers since 2008.
Each book has a one sentence review along with connections to similar or
related books and a thought or two on why I felt the book is important.
When you sign up, I‚Äôll immediately send you five all-time favorite
recommendations, along with resources I‚Äôve created to help you read to
lead or even write your own book. Subscribe to the Reading List email
Since I first started the Reading List Email in 2008, people often asked
why I linked to Amazon in instead of indie bookstores. For a long time,
I told them to hang on‚Ä¶because my dream was always to open my own shop.
Well, in 2021, I did just that. You can read this Texas Monthly piece I
wrote about the insane journey it was to start a small town bookstore
during the middle of a pandemic. Our store The Painted Porch is now open
on Main St in Bastrop, Texas and doing great. The obstacle was more than
the way‚Äîit‚Äôs been an incredibly rewarding (although deeply challenging)
experience. Just as the goal with the Reading List Email was that I
wanted to celebrate other people‚Äôs works, The Painted Porch has become
an extension of the idea of celebrating other people‚Äôs work. Since 2008,
I‚Äôve recommended close to 3,600 books and over 1,000,000 pages. At the
end of each year I do a recap of the best books I‚Äôve read that year.
Check out the best of lists I did in 2023, 2022, 2021, 2020, 2019, 2018,
2017, 2016, 2015, 2014, 2013, 2012 and 2011.) The email list has over
300,000 loyal subscribers. Readers include Big Six book editors,
authors, students, entrepreneurs, NFL coaches, celebrities, book store
owners, executives, and everyone in between. It‚Äôs the secret weapon for
anyone looking to read to lead and improve themselves. Because of what I
do for a living (writing bestselling books, owning a bookstore, working
with bestselling authors, marketing¬†and advising a handful of high
profile clients), I‚Äôm always stumbling on interesting books that I am in
a unique position to share. This has meant everything from books 80
years out of print, review galley‚Äôs of future bestsellers, the Classics,
and more. You can get a sense what‚Äôs to come on my list of¬†Books to Base
Your Life On.¬†Enter your email address below to these unique
recommendations every month via email. Tweet

Cultural norms, complex religious influences and friendly police

[How to Negotiate with a

People, including negotiators, lie every day, so when you’re trying to
make a deal, it’s important to defend against deception. The best
strategy, says the author, is to focus not on detecting lies but on
preventing them. She outlines five tactics that research has shown to be
effective: Encourage reciprocity. You can build trust and prompt other
parties to disclose strategic information by sharing information
yourself. Ask the right questions. Negotiators often lie by omission,
keeping mum about relevant facts, but if directly asked, they are more
likely to respond honestly. Watch for dodging. Don’t let your
counterparts sidestep your questions—write them down in advance, take
notes on the answers, and make sure you get the information you’re
seeking. Don’t dwell on confidentiality. Studies show that the more you
reassure others that you’ll protect their privacy, the more guarded and
apt to lie they become. So be nonchalant when discussing sensitive
topics. Cultivate leaks. People often reveal information unwittingly, so
listen carefully for any slips and try indirect approaches to gaining
information.

Online dating site OKCupid has found an inexplicable number of men
happen to be exactly six feet tall and there are four times as many
people who claim to earn \$100,000 per year as there should be. False
advertising, or misrepresentation, is standard in any marketplace; the
dating market is no different.

At most gyms, there’s a cylindrical pad on the floor somewhere near the
squat rack. (If it’s not there, check the Smith machine.) When I first
started squatting, I needed that pad on the bar—or thought I did. How
else would I protect my bony neck? But the truth is, you don’t need that
pad. And if you’re planning to lift more and more over the years (which
you will, you beast, you), you’ll have to ditch it.

America, it’s the rise of emergency telemedicine in the poorest,
sickest, and most remote parts of the country, where the choice is
increasingly to have a doctor on screen or no doctor at all. These
physicians, often hundreds of miles away, work out of cubicles instead
of exam rooms and never directly see or touch their patients.

Clinical and nonclinical staff at the Rotterdam Eye Hospital have
improved patient care and raised staff morale at a very modest cost: 10
minutes a day and a special deck of cards. At the start of every shift,
the team members get together for a brief “team-start.” Each team member
rates his or her own mood as green (I’m good), orange (I’m okay but I
have a few things I’m concerned about) or red (I’m under stress). The
rest of the team doesn’t need to know that you’re under stress because
you’re having a dispute with your landlord or you are worried about your
ill toddler. How you feel, however, is important because it affects how
you should be treated. Next, the team leader asks if there is anything
in particular the team needs to know to work more effectively together
that shift: For example, “Is there a delay in public transport so we can
expect patients to be late for their appointments?,” or “Is there a
patient with some kind of special need coming in?” Sharing the answers
or results generated by the card questions and activities with the group
ensures that the insights stick.

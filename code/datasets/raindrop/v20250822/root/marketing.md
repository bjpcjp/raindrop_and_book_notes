Whether or not you should pursue a catalog strategy is a question that
deserves significant thought. As digital marketing becomes more complex,
it may make a lot of sense to send out correctly designed catalogs to
the right customers. For e-commerce retailers without physical stores,
catalogs can effectively mimic stores’ sensory experiences to enhance
customer affinity. For multichannel retailers, by understanding the
channel preferences of current customers through transactional data,
multichannel retailers can add an effective catalog marketing channel to
their store and e-commerce channel strategies.

</div>

Competitive poaching refers to the practice of bidding on ads for a
competitor’s search terms, in order to poach customers searching for
that brand. It’s a common tactic in the world of digital ads — but is it
effective? The author shares results from the first-ever empirical study
of this practice, which found that poaching can work well for higher-end
brands, but may backfire for lower-end or mass market offerings.
Specifically, the study found that when an ad poached customers who
searched for a high-end brand, users clicked on it more, but when an ad
poached a low-end or mass market target, users were less likely to
click. Of course, the author notes that clickthrough rate is just one
metric, and there may be other ways in which a poaching campaign could
be harmful or beneficial. But these findings can help marketers add a
bit of science to the art that is digital advertising, helping them to
optimize campaigns for their unique products and customers.

</div>

Consumers are more likely to buy embarrassing products when their
embarrassment is mitigated by more-anonymous packaging. Specifically,
consumers found products packaged in boxes with cool colors, small
lettering, and a picture of the product to be more anonymous (and

medium or large lettering, and no picture. The findings show that the
more anonymous a product looks, the less embarrassing a consumer finds
it, and the more likely they are to purchase it.

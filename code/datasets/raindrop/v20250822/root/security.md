You’re six months into a project when you realize a tiny, simple
assumption you made at the start was completely wrong. And now you need
to fix the problem while keeping the existing system running—with far
more effort than it would’ve taken if you’d just gotten it right in the
first place. Today I’d like to tell you about one common mistake, a
single word that will cause you endless trouble. I am speaking, of
course, about “users”. There are two basic problems with this word:
“User” is almost never a good description of your requirements. “User”
encourages a fundamental security design flaw. The concept “user” is
dangerously vague, and you will almost always be better off using more
accurate terminology.

[APT Encounters of the Third Kind - Igor’s
Blog](https://igor-blue.github.io/2021/03/24/apt1.html)

</div>

A few weeks ago an ordinary security assessment turned into an incident
response whirlwind. It was definitely a first for me, and I was kindly
granted permission to outline the events in this blog post. This
investigation started scary but turned out be quite fun, and I hope
reading it will be informative to you too. I'll be back to posting about
my hardware research soon. How it started What hell is this? The NFS
Server 2nd malicious binary Further forensics Eureka Moment The GOlang
thingy How the kernel got patched? and why not the golang app? What we
have so far Q&A How it started Twice a year I am hired to do security
assessments for a specific client. We have been working together for
several years, and I had a pretty good understanding of their network
and what to look for. This time my POC, Klaus, asked me to focus on
privacy issues and GDPR compliance. However, he asked me to first look
at their cluster of reverse gateways / load balancers: I had some prior
knowledge of these gateways, but decided to start by creating my own
test environment first. The gateways run a custom Linux stack: basically
a monolithic compiled kernel (without any modules), and a static GOlang
application on top. The 100+ machines have no internal storage, but
rather boot from an external USB media that has the kernel and the
application. The GOlang app serves in two capacities: an init
replacement and the reverse gateway software. During initialization it
mounts /proc, /sys, devfs and so on, then mounts an NFS share hardcoded
in the app. The NFS share contains the app's configuration, TLS
certificates, blacklist data and a few more. It starts listening on 443,
filters incoming communication and passes valid requests on different
services in the production segment. I set up a self contained test
environment, and spent a day in black box examination. Having found
nothing much I suggested we move on to looking at the production
network, but Klaus insisted I continue with the gateways. Specifically
he wanted to know if I could develop a methodology for testing if an
attacker has gained access to the gateways and is trying to access PII
(Personally Identifiable Information) from within the decrypted HTTP
stream. I couldn't SSH into the host (no SSH), so I figured we will have
to add some kind of instrumentation to the GO app. Klaus still insisted
I start by looking at the traffic before (red) and after the GW (green),
and gave me access to a mirrored port on both sides so I could capture
traffic to a standalone laptop he prepared for me and I could access
through an LTE modem but was not allowed to upload data from: The
problem I faced now was how to find out what HTTPS traffic corresponded
to requests with embedded PII. One possible avenue was to try and
correlate the encrypted traffic with the decrypted HTTP traffic. This
proved impossible using timing alone. However, unspecting the decoded
traffic I noticed the GW app adds an 'X-Orig-Connection' with the
four-tuple of the TLS connection! Yay! I wrote a small python program to
scan the port 80 traffic capture and create a mapping from each
four-tuple TLS connection to a boolean - True for connection with PII
and False for all others:
10.4.254.254,443,\[Redacted\],43404,376106847.319,False
10.4.254.254,443,\[Redacted\],52064,376106856.146,False
10.4.254.254,443,\[Redacted\],40946,376106856.295,False
10.4.254.254,443,\[Redacted\],48366,376106856.593,False
10.4.254.254,443,\[Redacted\],48362,376106856.623,True
10.4.254.254,443,\[Redacted\],45872,376106856.645,False
10.4.254.254,443,\[Redacted\],40124,376106856.675,False ... With this in
mind I could now extract the data from the PCAPs and do some
correlations. After a few long hours getting scapy to actually parse
timestamps consistently enough for comparisons, I had a list of
connection timing information correlated with PII. A few more fun hours
with Excel and I got histogram graphs of time vs count of packets.
Everything looked normal for the HTTP traffic, although I expected more
of a normal distribution than the power-low type thingy I got. Port 443
initially looked the same, and I got the normal distribution I expected.
But when filtering for PII something was seriously wrong. The
distribution was skewed and shifted to longer time frames. And there was
nothing similar on the port 80 end. My only explanation was that
something was wrong with my testing setup (the blue bars) vs. the real
live setup (the orange bars). I wrote on our slack channel 'I think my
setup is sh\*t, can anyone resend me the config files?', but this was
already very late at night, and no one responded. Having a slight OCD I
couldn’t let this go. To my rescue came another security? feature of the
GWs: Thet restarted daily, staggered one by one, with about 10 minutes
between hosts. This means that every ten minutes or so one of them would
reboot, and thus reload it’s configuration files over NFS. And since I
could see the NFS traffic through the port mirror I had access to, I
recokoned I could get the production configuration files from the NFS
capture (bottom dotted blue line in the diagram before). So to cut a
long story short I found the NFS read reply packet, and got the data I
need. But … why the hack is eof 77685??? Come on people, its 3:34AM!
What's more, the actual data was 77685 bytes, exactly 8192 bytes more
then the ‘Read length’. The entropy for that data was pretty uniform,
suggesting it was encrypted. The file I had was definitely not
encrypted. Histogram of extra 8192 bytes: When I mounted the NFS export
myself I got a normal EOF value of 1! What hell is this? Comparing the
capture from my testing machine with the one from the port mirror I saw
something else weird: For other NFS open requests (on all of my test
system captures and for other files in the production system) we get:
Spot the difference? The open id: string became open-id:. Was I dealing
with some corrupt packet? But the exact same problem reappeared the next
time blacklist.db was send over the wire by another GW host. Time to
look at the kernel source code: The “open id” string is hardcoded.
What's up? After a good night sleep and no beer this time I repeated the
experiment and convincing myself I was not hullucinating I decided to
compare the source code of the exact kernel version with the kernel
binary I got. What I expected to see was this (from nfs4xdr.c): static
inline void encode_openhdr(struct xdr_stream \*xdr, const struct
nfs_openargs \*arg) { \_\_be32 \*p; /\* \* opcode 4, seqid 4,
share_access 4, share_deny 4, clientid 8, ownerlen 4, \* owner 4 = 32
\*/ encode_nfs4_seqid(xdr, arg-\>seqid); encode_share_access(xdr,
arg-\>share_access); p = reserve_space(xdr, 36); p = xdr_encode_hyper(p,
arg-\>clientid); \*p++ = cpu_to_be32(24); p = xdr_encode_opaque_fixed(p,
"open id:", 8); \*p++ = cpu_to_be32(arg-\>server-\>s_dev); \*p++ =
cpu_to_be32(arg-\>id.uniquifier); xdr_encode_hyper(p,
arg-\>id.create_time); } Running binwalk -e -M bzImage I got the
internal ELF image, and opened it in IDA. Of course I didn’t have any
symbols, but I got nfs4_xdr_enc_open() from /proc/kallsyms, and from
there to encode_open() which led me to encode_openhdr(). With some help
from hex-rays I got code that looked very similiar, but with one key
difference: static inline void encode_openhdr(struct xdr_stream \*xdr,
const struct nfs_openargs \*arg) { ... p = xdr_encode_opaque_fixed(p,
unknown_func("open id:", arg), 8); ... } The function unknown_func was
pretty long and complicated but eventually sometimes decided to replace
the space between 'open' and 'id' with a hyphen. Does the NFS server
care? Apparently this string it is some opaque client identifier that is
ignored by the NFS server, so no one would see the difference. That is
unless they were trying to extract something from an NFS stream, and
obviously this was not a likely scenario. OK, back to the weird 'eof'
thingy from the NFS server. The NFS Server The server was running the
'NFS-ganesha-3.3' package. This is a very modular user-space NFS server
that is implemented as a series of loadable modules called FSALs. For
example support for files on the regular filesystem is implemented
through a module called libfsalvfs.so. Having verified all the files on
disk had the same SHA1 as the distro package, I decided to dump the
process memory. I didn't have any tools on the host, so I used GDB which
helpfully was already there. Unexpectadly GDB was suddenly killed, the
file I specified as output got erased, and the nfs server process
restarted. I took the dump again but there was nothing special there! I
was pretty suspicious at this time, and wanted to recover the original
dump file from the first dump. Fortunately for me I was dumping the file
to the laptop, again over NFS. The file had been deleted, but I managed
to recover it from the disk on that server. 2nd malicious binary The
memory dump was truncated, but had a corrupt version of NFS-ganesha
inside. There were two libfsalvfs.so libraries loaded: the original one
and an injected SO file with the same name. The injected file was
clearly malicious. The main binary was patched in a few places, and the
function table into libfsalvfs.so as replaced with the alternate
libfsalvfs.so. The alternate file was compiled from NFS-ganesha sources,
but modified to include new and improved (wink wink) functionality. The
most interesting of the new functionality were two separate
implementations of covert channels. The first one we encountered
already: When an open request comes in with 'open-id' instead of 'open
id', the file handle is marked. This change is opaque to the NFS server,
so unpatched servers just ignore it and nothing much happens. For
infiltrated NFS server, when the file handle opened this way is read,
the NFS server appends the last block with a payload coming from the
malwar...

Sometimes people want to get a certificate for the hostname “localhost”,
either for use in local development, or for distribution with a native
application that needs to communicate with a web application. Let’s
Encrypt can’t provide certificates for “localhost” because nobody
uniquely owns it, and it’s not rooted in a top level domain like “.com”
or “.net”. It’s possible to set up your own domain name that happens to
resolve to 127.

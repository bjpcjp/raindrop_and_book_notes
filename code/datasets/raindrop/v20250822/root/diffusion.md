The recent advancements in machine learning, particularly in generative
models, have been marked by the emergence of diffusion models (DMs) as
powerful tools for modeling complex data distributions and generating
realistic samples across various domains such as images, videos, audio,
and 3D scenes. Despite their practical success, the full theoretical
understanding of generative diffusion models still needs to be improved.
This understanding is not just an academic pursuit but has direct
implications for the practical application of these models in various
domains.  While rigorous results assessing their convergence on
finite-dimensional data have been obtained, the complexities of
high-dimensional data spaces

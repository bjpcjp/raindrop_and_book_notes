[The Hard Truth About Innovative

</div>

Innovative cultures are generally depicted as pretty fun. They’re
characterized by a tolerance for failure and a willingness to
experiment. They’re seen as being psychologically safe, highly
collaborative, and nonhierarchical. And research suggests that these
behaviors translate into better innovative performance. But despite the
fact that innovative cultures are desirable, and that most leaders claim
to understand what they entail, they are hard to create and sustain.
That’s because the easy-to-like behaviors that get so much attention are
only one side of the coin. They must be counterbalanced by some tougher
and frankly less fun behaviors: an intolerance for incompetence,
rigorous discipline, brutal candor, a high level of individual
accountability, and strong leadership. Unless the tensions created by
this paradox are carefully managed, attempts to create an innovative
culture will fail.

Curiosity is incredibly important for organizations, yet leaders
assume—mistakenly for the most part—that their employees feel empowered
to be curious. They see few barriers themselves to asking questions and
assume the same is true for their employees. But employees describe a
very different reality. 83% of C-level or president-level executives say
curiosity is encouraged “a great deal” or “a good amount” at their
company. Just 52% of individual contributors say the same. This gap
seems to be driven in part by perceptions of the value of curiosity.
While about half (49%) of the C-level believes curiosity is rewarded by
salary growth, only 16% of individual contributors agree. A staggering
81% of individual contributors are convinced curiosity makes no material
difference in their compensation.

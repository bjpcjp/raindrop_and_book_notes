Claude and ChatGPT are two compelling options in AI chatbots, each with
unique features and capabilities. To discern their strengths and
suitability for various applications, let's compare these two AI
chatbots comprehensively. What is Claude? Claude is an AI chatbot
developed by an Anthropic AI renowned for its ability to simulate
human-like conversations. Built on sophisticated NLP algorithms, Claude
excels in engaging users in meaningful dialogues across a spectrum of
topics. What sets Claude apart is its emphasis on understanding the
user's persona and tailoring responses to match individual preferences
and communication styles. This personalised touch enhances user
experience, fostering

blog post: https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/ - The GPU I'm training the
model on is from Lambda GPU Cloud, I think the best and easiest way to
spin up an on-demand GPU instance in the cloud that you can ssh to:
https://lambdalabs.com . If you prefer to work in notebooks, I think the
easiest path today is Google Colab. Suggested exercises: - EX1: The
n-dimensional tensor mastery challenge: Combine the \`Head\` and
\`MultiHeadAttention\` into one class that processes all the heads in
parallel, treating the heads as another batch dimension (answer is in
nanoGPT). - EX2: Train the GPT on your own dataset of choice! What other
data could be fun to blabber on about? (A fun advanced suggestion if you
like: train a GPT to do addition of two numbers, i.e. a+b=c. You may
find it helpful to predict the digits of c in reverse order, as the
typical addition algorithm (that you're hoping it learns) would proceed
right to left too. You may want to modify the data loader to simply
serve random problems and skip the generation of train.bin, val.bin. You
may want to mask out the loss at the input positions of a+b that just
specify the problem using y=-1 in the targets (see CrossEntropyLoss
ignore_index). Does your Transformer learn to add? Once you have this,
swole doge project: build a calculator clone in GPT, for all of +-\*/.
Not an easy problem. You may need Chain of Thought traces.) - EX3: Find
a dataset that is very large, so large that you can't see a gap between
train and val loss. Pretrain the transformer on this data, then
initialize with that model and finetune it on tiny shakespeare with a
smaller number of steps and lower learning rate. Can you obtain a lower
validation loss by the use of pretraining? - EX4: Read some transformer
papers and implement one additional feature or change that people seem
to use. Does it improve the performance of your GPT? Chapters: 00:00:00

Do you use Python, Pandas, and Seaborn to collect, analyze, and plot
data? Then you'll be amazed by what ChatGPT can do, when using ChatGPT+,
GPT-4 model, and the plugin for Noteable's version of Jupyter notebooks.
\[UPDATE/NOTE: This was my first summary of Noteable and ChatGPT. I have
done more experiments, which you can see here:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WUZ0b-hUDU\] In this video, I show you
how I got things set up for using Noteable (and world headlines), then
put together a query, You'll see how it goes well, where it goes wrong,
and what sort of code I can create using just English-language
descriptions of my plans. And I show you what's happening behind the
scenes, as we see the JSON being written. This is all brand new and
exciting, and I hope that you'll post suggestions and ideas in the
comments for how we can take this even further! And if you're interested
in analyzing data with Pandas, check out Bamboo Weekly at
https://www.BambooWeekly.com/, where I look at current events through
the eyes of data analysis.

</div>

It’s March 2023 and right now ChatGPT, the amazing AI chatbot tool from
OpenAI, is all the rage. But when OpenAI released their public web API
for ChatGPT on the 1st of March you might have been a bit disappointed.
If you’re an R user, that is. Because, when scrolling through the
release announcement you find that there is a python package to use this
new API, but no R package. I’m here to say: Don’t be disappointed! As
long as there is a web API for a service then it’s going to be easy to
use this service from R, no specialized package needed. So here’s an
example of how to use the new (as of March 2023) ChatGPT API from R. But
know that when the next AI API hotness comes out (likely April 2023, or
so) then it’s going to be easy to interface with that from R, as well.
Calling the ChatGPT web API from R To use the ChatGPT API in any way you
first need to sign up and get an API key: The “password” you need to
access the web API. It could look something like
"sk-5xWWxmbnJvbWU4-M212Z2g5dzlu-MzhucmI5Yj-l4c2RkdmZ26". Of course,
that’s not my real API key because that’s something you should keep
secret! With an API key at hand you now look up the documentation and
learn that this is how you would send a request to the API from the
terminal: curl https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions \\ -H
"Authorization: Bearer \$OPENAI_API_KEY" \\ -H "Content-Type:
application/json" \\ -d '{ "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "messages":
\[{"role": "user", "content": "What is a banana?"}\] }' But how do we
send a request to the API using R? What we can do is to “replicate” this
call using httr: a popular R package to send HTTP requests. Here’s how
this request would be made using httr (with the curl lines as comments
above the corresponding httr code) library(httr) api_key

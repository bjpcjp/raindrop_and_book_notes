    <p class="card-excerpt">A few years ago, Google decided to research what was the key ingredient that made some software teams at the company more successful than others. Much to their surprise the key trait that was most correlated with successful teams wasn’t technical prowess, personalities or the educational background of the team members. Instead it was the notion of psychological safety — “ a shared belief held by members of a team that the team is safe for interpersonal risk-taking.’’</p>

    <p class="card-excerpt">Innovative cultures are generally depicted as pretty fun. They’re characterized by a tolerance for failure and a willingness to experiment. They’re seen as being psychologically safe, highly collaborative, and nonhierarchical. And research suggests that these behaviors translate into better innovative performance. But despite the fact that innovative cultures are desirable, and that most leaders claim to understand what they entail, they are hard to create and sustain. That’s because the easy-to-like behaviors that get so much attention are only one side of the coin. They must be counterbalanced by some tougher and frankly less fun behaviors: an intolerance for incompetence, rigorous discipline, brutal candor, a high level of individual accountability, and strong leadership. Unless the tensions created by this paradox are carefully managed, attempts to create an innovative culture will fail.</p>

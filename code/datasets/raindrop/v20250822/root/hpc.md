Fujitsu Limited today announced that it began shipping the supercomputer
Fugaku, which is jointly developed with RIKEN and promoted by the
Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology with the
aim of starting general operation between 2021 and 2022. The first
machine to be shipped this time is one of the computer units of Fugaku,
a supercomputer system comprised of over 150,000 high-performance CPUs
connected together. Fujitsu will continue to deliver the units to RIKEN
Center for Computational Science in Kobe, Japan, for installation and
tuning.

Dyson almost launched a robot vacuum. Back in 2001, after three years in
development. Its first effort, shown to the British public in London
looked nothing (and we mean nothing) like the eventual 360 Eye unveiled
today. Sixteen years is a long time in tech. The DC06, as it was called,
never made it past home-trial stages in 2012 -- apparently too pricey
and heavy. Between then and now, technology got better. A lot better. At
the Tokyo launch of its new robot vacuum, Sir James Dyson himself, told
us how it all came together, and why it's not his native UK, but Japan,
that'll get to buy it first.

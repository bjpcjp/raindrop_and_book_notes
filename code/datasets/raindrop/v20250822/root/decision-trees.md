In the era of hyper-sophisticated machine learning models like ChatGPT,
it is surprising how effective the classic decision tree model remains,
especially when used in conjunction with other techniques, such as
bagging, boosting and random forests. In this blog post we demonstrate
how to build an effective decision tree model, and train this model on
some sample data.

Recursive queries are a straightforward solution to querying
hierarchical trees. However, one loop in the relationship references
results in a failing or never ending query when cycle detection is not
used.

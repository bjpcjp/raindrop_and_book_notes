The International Bartenders Association, or IBA, maintains a list of
official cocktails, ones they deem to be “the most requested recipes” at
bars all around the world. It’s the closest thing the bartending
industry has to a canonical list of cocktails, akin to the American
Kennel Club’s registry of dog breeds or a jazz musician’s Real Book of
standards.

[Fresh Corn and Black Bean Salad With Corn

</div>

This superquick corn and black bean salad is enlivened with crackly corn
chips, in the spirit of salads like fattoush, panzanella and crispy
noodle salad. When corn is at its peak, its subtly sweet raw kernels are
plump and juicy, and the perfect addition to salads. Corn pairs
beautifully with earthy black beans and this sprightly cumin-lime
vinaigrette. The corn, black beans, cilantro and vinaigrette can mingle
up to 4 hours ahead, so this make-ahead dish is perfect for a picnic,
potluck, cookout, or simply dinner. For best results, toss in the corn
chips and avocado just before serving.

put it in the sink. \[…\]

This standalone lemon cake needs no adornment; no glaze or drizzle, no
syrupy soak (just a light dusting of powdered sugar if you want it to be
beauty contest-ready) – yet it practically oozes with glowing citrus
flavor, thanks to the fruity olive oil, tangy yogurt and a dash of piney
nutmeg that highlight the various facets of lemon’s character White
chocolate and almond flour add hints of the nutty richness and velvety
crumb of an almond torte to what looks like a simple yellow cake Always
seek out organic lemons for zesting, as conventional lemons can be
coated with a wax you shouldn’t eat.

miso that completes the dish: Whisked with the starchy pasta water and

Pasta heated in the skillet with sauce has a vastly different and
superior flavor and texture compared with pasta that is simply sauced on
the plate. No matter how great a sauce you can make, if you don't sauce
your pasta correctly, you're missing out on one of life's greatest
pleasures. Conversely, even a so-so jarred marinara sauce can be
improved upon by finishing it off right. Here's how to properly sauce
your pasta, step by step.

There’s just enough oil to slick all the crispy bits of chile, onion and
sesame in this version of the spicy Chinese condiment, so it delivers as

fresh minced onion, and it improves the crispness, too You can
experiment by mixing the hot and fruity flavors of different dried chile
varieties, crushing them into flaky bits, or stick with ready-to-add
red-pepper flakes

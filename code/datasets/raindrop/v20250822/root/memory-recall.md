[Doorway effect](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doorway_effect)

</div>

The 'doorway effect' or 'location updating effect' is a replicable
psychological phenomenon characterized by short-term memory loss when
passing through a doorway or moving from one location to another.\[1\]
We tend to forget items of recent significance immediately after
crossing a boundary\[2\] and often forget what we were thinking about or
planning on doing upon entering a different room.\[3\] Research suggests
that this phenomenon occurs both at literal boundaries (e.g., moving
from one room to another via a door) and metaphorical boundaries (e.g.,
imagining traversing a doorway, or even when moving from one desktop
window to another on a computer).\[2\]

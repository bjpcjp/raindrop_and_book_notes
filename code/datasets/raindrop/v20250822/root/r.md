Which layout of an advertisement leads to more clicks? Would a different
color or position of the purchase button lead to a higher conversion
rate? Does a special offer really attract more customers – and which of
two phrasings would be better? For a long time, people have trusted
their gut feeling to answer these questions. Today all these questions
could be answered by conducting an A/B test. For this purpose, visitors
of a website are randomly assigned to one of two groups between which
the target metric (i.e. click-through rate, conversion rate…) can then
be compared. Due to this randomization, the groups do not systematically
differ in all other relevant dimensions. This means: If your target
metric takes a significantly higher value in one group, you can be quite
sure that it is because of your treatment and not because of any other
variable. In comparison to other methods, conducting an A/B test does
not require extensive statistical knowledge. Nevertheless, some caveats
have to be taken into account. When making a statistical decision, there
are two possible errors (see also table 1): A Type I error means that we
observe a significant result although there is no real difference
between our groups. A Type II error means that we do not observe a
significant result although there is in fact a difference. The Type I
error can be controlled and set to a fixed number in advance, e.g., at
5%, often denoted as α or the significance level. The Type II error in
contrast cannot be controlled directly. It decreases with the sample
size and the magnitude of the actual effect. When, for example, one of
the designs performs way better than the other one, it’s more likely
that the difference is actually detected by the test in comparison to a
situation where there is only a small difference with respect to the
target metric. Therefore, the required sample size can be computed in
advance, given α and the minimum effect size you want to be able to
detect (statistical power analysis). Knowing the average traffic on the
website you can get a rough idea of the time you have to wait for the
test to complete. Setting the rule for the end of the test in advance is
often called “fixed-horizon testing”. Table 1: Overview over possible
errors and correct decisions in statistical tests Effect really exists
No Yes Statistical test is significant No True negative Type II error
(false negative) Yes Type I error (false positive) True positive
Statistical tests generally provide the p-value which reflects the
probability of obtaining the observed result (or an even more extreme
one) just by chance, given that there is no effect. If the p-value is
smaller than α, the result is denoted as “significant”. When running an
A/B test you may not always want to wait until the end but take a look
from time to time to see how the test performs. What if you suddenly
observe that your p-value has already fallen below your significance
level – doesn’t that mean that the winner has already been identified
and you could stop the test? Although this conclusion is very appealing,
it can also be very wrong. The p-value fluctuates strongly during the
experiment and even if the p-value at the end of the fixed-horizon is
substantially larger than α, it can go below α at some point during the
experiment. This is the reason why looking at your p-value several times
is a little bit like cheating, because it makes your actual probability
of a Type I error substantially larger than the α you chose in advance.
This is called “α inflation”. At best you only change the color or
position of a button although it does not have any impact. At worst,
your company provides a special offer which causes costs but actually no
gain. The more often you check your p-value during the data collection,
the more likely you are to draw wrong conclusions. In short: As
attractive as it may seem, don’t stop your A/B test early just because
you are observing a significant result. In fact you can prove that if
you increase your time horizon to infinity, you are guaranteed to get a
significant p-value at some point in time. The following code simulates
some data and plots the course of the p-value during the test. (For the
first samples which are still very small R returns a warning that the
chi square approximation may be incorrect.) library(timeDate)

[3 Reasons to Learn
Caret](https://www.r-bloggers.com/3-reasons-to-learn-caret)

</div>

Machine learning is the study and application of algorithms that learn
from and make predictions on data. From search results to self-driving
cars, it has manifested itself in all areas of our lives and is one of
the most exciting and fast-growing fields of research in the world of
data science. The caret package, maintained by Max Kuhn, is the go-to
package in the R community for predictive modeling and supervised
learning. This widely used package provides a consistent interface to
all of R's most powerful machine learning facilities. Need some more
convincing? In this post, we explore 3 reasons why you should learn the
caret package. Afterward, you can take DataCamp's Machine Learning
Toolbox course taught by Zachary Deane-Mayer & Max Kuhn, co-authors of
the caret package! 1. It can help you get a data science job Ever read
through data science job postings and see words like "predictive
modeling", "classification", "regression," or "machine learning"?
Chances are if you are seeking a data science position, you will be
expected to have experience and knowledge about all of these topics.
Luckily, the caret package has you covered. The caret package is known
as the "Swiss Army Knife" for machine learning with R; capable of
performing many tasks with an intuitive, consistent format. Check out
these recent data scientist job postings from Kaggle which are all
seeking candidates with knowledge of R and machine learning: Data
Scientist Analytics at Booking.com Data Scientist at Amazon.com Data
Scientist at CVS Health 2. It's one of the most popular R packages The
caret package receives over 38,000 direct downloads monthly making it
one of the most popular packages in the R community. With that comes
significant benefits including an abundant amount of documentation and
helpful tutorials. You can install the Rdocumentation package to access
helpful documentation and community examples directly in your R console.
Simply copy and paste the following code: \# Install and load
RDocumentation for comprehensive help with R packages and functions
install.packages("RDocumentation") library("RDocumentation") Of course,
another benefit of learning a widely used package is that your
colleagues are also likely using caret in their work - meaning you can
collaborate on projects more easily. Additionally, caret is a dependent
package for a large amount of additional machine learning and modeling
packages as well. Understanding how caret works will make it easier and
more fluid to learn even more helpful R packages. 3. It's easy to learn,
but very powerful If you are a beginner R user, the caret package
provides an easy interface for performing complex tasks. For example,
you can train multiple different types of models with one easy,
convenient format. You can also monitor various combinations of
parameters and evaluate performance to understand their impact on the
model you are trying to build. Additionally, the caret package helps you
decide the most suitable model by comparing their accuracy and
performance for a specific problem. Complete the code challenge below to
see just how easy it is to to build models and predict values with
caret. We've already gone ahead and split the mtcars dataset into a
training set, train, and a test set,test. Both of these objects are
available in the console. Your goal is to predict the miles per gallon
of each car in the test dataset based on their weight. See for yourself
how the caret package can handle this task with just two lines of code!

With roots dating back to at least 1662 when John Graunt, a London
merchant, published an extensive set of inferences based on mortality
records, survival analysis is one of the oldest subfields of Statistics
\[1\]. Basic life-table methods, including techniques for dealing with
censored data, were discovered before 1700 \[2\], and in the early
eighteenth century, the old masters - de Moivre working on annuities,
and Daniel Bernoulli studying competing risks for the analysis of
smallpox inoculation - developed the modern foundations of the field
\[2\]. Today, survival analysis models are important in Engineering,
Insurance, Marketing, Medicine, and many more application areas. So, it
is not surprising that R should be rich in survival analysis functions.
CRAN’s Survival Analysis Task View, a curated list of the best relevant
R survival analysis packages and functions, is indeed formidable. We all
owe a great deal of gratitude to Arthur Allignol and Aurielien Latouche,
the task view maintainers. Looking at the Task View on a small screen,
however, is a bit like standing too close to a brick wall - left-right,
up-down, bricks all around. It is a fantastic edifice that gives some
idea of the significant contributions R developers have made both to the
theory and practice of Survival Analysis. As well-organized as it is,
however, I imagine that even survival analysis experts need some time to
find their way around this task view. Newcomers - people either new to R
or new to survival analysis or both - must find it overwhelming. So, it
is with newcomers in mind that I offer the following narrow trajectory
through the task view that relies on just a few packages: survival,
ggplot2, ggfortify, and ranger The survival package is the cornerstone
of the entire R survival analysis edifice. Not only is the package
itself rich in features, but the object created by the Surv() function,
which contains failure time and censoring information, is the basic
survival analysis data structure in R. Dr. Terry Therneau, the package
author, began working on the survival package in 1986. The first public
release, in late 1989, used the Statlib service hosted by Carnegie
Mellon University. Thereafter, the package was incorporated directly
into Splus, and subsequently into R. ggfortify enables producing
handsome, one-line survival plots with ggplot2::autoplot. ranger might
be the surprise in my very short list of survival packages. The ranger()
function is well-known for being a fast implementation of the Random
Forests algorithm for building ensembles of classification and
regression trees. But ranger() also works with survival data. Benchmarks
indicate that ranger() is suitable for building time-to-event models
with the large, high-dimensional data sets important to internet
marketing applications. Since ranger() uses standard Surv() survival
objects, it’s an ideal tool for getting acquainted with survival
analysis in this machine-learning age. Load the data This first block of
code loads the required packages, along with the veteran dataset from
the survival package that contains data from a two-treatment, randomized
trial for lung cancer. library(survival) library(ranger)

first thing to do is to use Surv() to build the standard survival
object. The variable time records survival time; status indicates
whether the patient’s death was observed (status = 1) or that survival
time was censored (status = 0). Note that a “+” after the time in the
print out of km indicates censoring. \# Kaplan Meier Survival Curve km

Nicolas Nguyen works in the Supply Chain industry, in the area of Demand
and Supply Planning, S&OP and Analytics, where he enjoys developing
solutions using R and Shiny. Outside his job, he teaches data
visualization in R at the Engineering School EIGSI and Business School
Excelia in the city of La Rochelle, France. Introduction Demand & Supply
Planning requires forecasting techniques to determine the inventory
needed to fulfill future orders. With R, we can build end-to-end supply
chain monitoring processes to identify potential issues and run scenario
testing. In a 3-part series, I will walk through a Demand & Supply
Planning workflow: Using R in Inventory Management and Demand
Forecasting: an introduction of projected inventory and coverage
methodology (this post) Analyzing Projected Inventory Calculations Using
R: an analysis of a demo dataset using the planr package Visualizing
Projected Calculations with reactable and shiny: once the analysis is
done, how would you present your results to your boss? By the end of the
series, you will understand how and why to use R for Demand & Supply
Planning calculations. Let’s begin! The “problem” we aim to solve When
we work in Demand & Supply Planning, it’s pretty common that we need to
calculate projected inventories (and related projected coverages). We
often have three options to perform this calculation, using: an APS
(Advanced Planning System) software an ERP, such as SAP or JDE and of
course…Excel! All are fine and have different pros and cons. For
example, we simply sometimes don’t have all the data in our ERP either
APS, like when we work with third-party distributors or we want to model
a supply chain network that relies on different systems with unconnected
data. How about using R to perform these calculations? How simple and
fast could they be? And, could we do more than just the calculations?
For example, could we get an analysis of the projected situation of a
portfolio (as an output of a function), so we don’t have to look at each
product one by one and can instead: Easily get a summary view of the
portfolio? Then zoom on the products with risks of shortages or
overstocks? In a series of posts, I will demonstrate how R can help us
in Demand & Supply planning. This first post introduces the proj_inv()
and light_proj_inv() functions for projected inventory and coverage
calculations. proj_inv(): to calculate projected inventories and
coverages with some analysis features light_proj_inv(): to calculate
projected inventories and coverages (only) Runs faster than the previous
function (as it’s lighter and doesn’t provide any analysis features)
With R, we have an efficient way to run end-to-end supply chain
monitoring processes. Methodology How to calculate projected inventories
First, let’s have a look at an example of how to calculate projected
inventories. Consider that the field Demand = Sales Forecasts. We start
with some Opening Inventory of 1000 units. During month M, we sell 100
units (the Demand). At the end of the 1st period (Month M), the
inventory is 900 units. Then, there’s a demand of 800 units at the end
of the following period (Month M+1). During the period (Month M+2), we
get a Supply of 400 units, and sell 100: it is now 1100 units in stock.
That’s all, this is how we calculate projected inventories ☺ Figure 1:
Describes the mechanism of the calculation of projected inventories
based on Opening Inventories, Demand and Supply How to calculate
projected coverages Now, let’s have a look at how to calculate projected
coverages. The idea: we look forward. We consider the projected
inventories at the end of a period and evaluate the related coverage
based on the Upcoming Demand. See the example below: Figure 2:
Description of the calculation of projected coverages, considering the
inventories at a point in time and the Upcoming Demand If we use Excel,
we often see a “shortcut” to estimate the related coverages, like
considering an average of the Demand over the next 3 or 6 months. This
can lead to incorrect results if the Demand is not constant (if we have
some seasonality or a strong trend, for example). However, these
calculations become very easy through the proj_inv() and
light_proj_inv() functions. Projected inventory calculations in R Now,
let’s see how the above is done using two functions from the planr
package. First, let’s create a tibble of data for the example shown
above (we will cover Min.Stocks.Coverage and Max.Stocks.Coverage more
thoroughly in another post): \# Install the planr package \#
remotes::install_github("nguyennico/planr") library(planr)
library(dplyr) Planr_Example % select(Projected.Inventories.Qty) \## \#
A tibble: 7 × 2 \## \# Groups: DFU \[1\] \## DFU
Projected.Inventories.Qty \## \## 1 Item0001 900 \## 2 Item0001 800 \##
3 Item0001 1100 \## 4 Item0001 300 \## 5 Item0001 200 \## 6 Item0001
-100 \## 7 Item0001 200 We can also take a look at projected coverage.
It matches our example calculation in Figure 2: the opening coverage is
2.9 months. Calculated_Inv %\>% select(Calculated.Coverage.in.Periods)
\## \# A tibble: 7 × 2 \## \# Groups: DFU \[1\] \## DFU
Calculated.Coverage.in.Periods \## \## 1 Item0001 2.9 \## 2 Item0001 1.9
\## 3 Item0001 2.7 \## 4 Item0001 1.7 \## 5 Item0001 0.7 \## 6 Item0001
0 \## 7 Item0001 99 Very easy to calculate! The proj_inv() and
light_proj_inv() functions can also be used and combined to perform more
complex tasks. I’ve described several use cases in the appendix. Moving
forward, these functions form the basis for the classic DRP
(Distribution Requirement Planning) calculation, where, based on some
parameters (usually minimum and maximum levels of stock, a reorder
quantity, and a frozen horizon), we calculate a Replenishment Plan.
Conclusion Thank you for reading this introduction of projected
inventories and coverages in Demand & Supply Planning! I hope that you
enjoyed reading how this methodology translate into R. ASCM (formerly
APICS) guidelines In the beginning of 2019, the Association for Supply
Chain Management (ASCM) published an article about the usage of R (and
Python) in Supply Chain Planning, and more precisely for the Sales &
Operations Planning (S&OP) process, which is related to Demand and
Supply Planning. Figure 3: An extract from the ASCM article regarding
the S&OP and Digital Supply Chain. It shows how R and Python are
becoming more and more used for demand & supply planning and are great
tools to run a S&OP process. In the example above, we can see how R
helps build the digital environment useful to run the S&OP process,
which involves a lot of data processing. The planr package aims to
support this process by providing functions that calculate projected
inventories. Stay tuned for more on projected calculations using R Thank
you for reading the introduction on how to use R for projected inventory
calculations in Demand & Supply Planning! I hope you enjoyed this
introduction to the planr package. My series of posts will continue

for a Shiny app showing a demo of the proj_inv() and light_proj_inv()
functions: Demo: app proj_inv() function (shinyapps.io) Appendix: Use
cases and examples The proj_inv() and light_proj_inv() functions can
easily be used and combined to perform more complex tasks, such as:
Modeling of a Supply Chain Network Calculation of projected inventories
from Raw Materials to Finished Goods A multi-echelon distribution
network: from a National Distribution Center to Regional Wholesalers to
Retailers Becoming a useful tool: To build an End-to-End Supply Chain
monitoring process To support the S&OP (Sales and Operations Planning)
process, allowing us to run some scenarios quickly: Change of Sales plan
Change of Supply (Production) plan Change of stock level parameters
Change of Transit Time Etc. Here are some detailed use cases for the
functions. Third-party distributors We sometimes work with third-party
distributors to distribute our products. A common question is: how much
stock do our partners hold? If we have access to their opening
inventories and Sales IN & OUT Forecasts, we can quickly calculate the
projected inventories by applying the proj_inv() or light_proj_inv()
functions. Then, we anticipate any risks of shortages or overstocks, and
create a collaborative workflow. Figure 4: Illustration of a SiSo (Sales
IN Sales OUT) situation. We have some stocks held at a storage location,
for example, a third-party distributor, and know what will be sold out
of this location (the sales out) and what will be replenished to it (the
sales in), as well as the opening inventory. The aim is to calculate the
projected inventories and coverages at this location. From raw materials
to finished goods In the example below, we produce olive oil (but it
could be shampoo, liquor, etc.). We start with a raw material, the olive
oil, that we use to fill up different sizes of bottles (35cl, 50cl,
etc…), on which we then apply (stick) a label (and back label). There
are different labels, depending on the languages (markets where the
products are sold). Once we have a labelled bottle, we put it inside an
outer box, ready to be shipped and sold. There are different dimensions
of outer boxes, where we can put, for examplem 4, 6 or 12 bottles. They
are the Finished Goods. We have two groups of products here: Finished

</div>

It’s March 2023 and right now ChatGPT, the amazing AI chatbot tool from
OpenAI, is all the rage. But when OpenAI released their public web API
for ChatGPT on the 1st of March you might have been a bit disappointed.
If you’re an R user, that is. Because, when scrolling through the
release announcement you find that there is a python package to use this
new API, but no R package. I’m here to say: Don’t be disappointed! As
long as there is a web API for a service then it’s going to be easy to
use this service from R, no specialized package needed. So here’s an
example of how to use the new (as of March 2023) ChatGPT API from R. But
know that when the next AI API hotness comes out (likely April 2023, or
so) then it’s going to be easy to interface with that from R, as well.
Calling the ChatGPT web API from R To use the ChatGPT API in any way you
first need to sign up and get an API key: The “password” you need to
access the web API. It could look something like
"sk-5xWWxmbnJvbWU4-M212Z2g5dzlu-MzhucmI5Yj-l4c2RkdmZ26". Of course,
that’s not my real API key because that’s something you should keep
secret! With an API key at hand you now look up the documentation and
learn that this is how you would send a request to the API from the
terminal: curl https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions \\ -H
"Authorization: Bearer \$OPENAI_API_KEY" \\ -H "Content-Type:
application/json" \\ -d '{ "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "messages":
\[{"role": "user", "content": "What is a banana?"}\] }' But how do we
send a request to the API using R? What we can do is to “replicate” this
call using httr: a popular R package to send HTTP requests. Here’s how
this request would be made using httr (with the curl lines as comments
above the corresponding httr code) library(httr) api_key

[Large scale eigenvalue decomposition and SVD with rARPACK \|

</div>

In January 2016, I was honored to receive an “Honorable Mention” of the
John Chambers Award 2016. This article was written for R-bloggers, whose
builder, Tal Galili, kindly invited me to write an introduction to the
rARPACK package. A Short Story of rARPACK Eigenvalue decomposition is a
commonly used technique in numerous statistical problems. For example,
principal component analysis (PCA) basically conducts eigenvalue
decomposition on the sample covariance of a data matrix: the eigenvalues
are the component variances, and eigenvectors are the variable loadings.
In R, the standard way to compute eigenvalues is the eigen() function.
However, when the matrix becomes large, eigen() can be very
time-consuming: the complexity to calculate all eigenvalues of a \$n
times n\$ matrix is \$O(n^3)\$. While in real applications, we usually
only need to compute a few eigenvalues or eigenvectors, for example to
visualize high dimensional data using PCA, we may only use the first two
or three components to draw a scatterplot. Unfortunately in eigen(),
there is no option to limit the number of eigenvalues to be computed.
This means that we always need to do the full eigen decomposition, which
can cause a huge waste in computation. And this is why the rARPACK
package was developed. As the name indicates, rARPACK was originally an
R wrapper of the ARPACK library, a FORTRAN package that is used to
calculate a few eigenvalues of a square matrix. However ARPACK has
stopped development for a long time, and it has some compatibility
issues with the current version of LAPACK. Therefore to maintain rARPACK
in a good state, I wrote a new backend for rARPACK, and that is the C++
library Spectra. The name of rARPACK was POORLY designed, I admit.
Starting from version 0.8-0, rARPACK no longer relies on ARPACK, but due
to CRAN polices and reverse dependence, I have to keep using the old
name. Features and Usage The usage of rARPACK is simple. If you want to
calculate some eigenvalues of a square matrix A, just call the function
eigs() and tells it how many eigenvalues you want (argument k), and
which eigenvalues to calculate (argument which). By default, which =
"LM" means to pick the eigenvalues with the largest magnitude (modulus
for complex numbers and absolute value for real numbers). If the matrix
is known to be symmetric, calling eigs_sym() is preferred since it
guarantees that the eigenvalues are real. library(rARPACK) set.seed(123)
\## Some random data x = matrix(rnorm(1000 \* 100), 1000) \## If retvec
== FALSE, we don't calculate eigenvectors eigs_sym(cov(x), k = 5, which
= "LM", opts = list(retvec = FALSE)) For really large data, the matrix
is usually in sparse form. rARPACK supports several sparse matrix types
defined in the Matrix package, and you can even pass an implicit matrix
defined by a function to eigs(). See ?rARPACK::eigs for details.
library(Matrix) spmat = as(cov(x), "dgCMatrix") eigs_sym(spmat, 2) \##
Implicitly define the matrix by a function that calculates A %\*% x \##
Below represents a diagonal matrix diag(c(1:10)) fmat = function(x,
args) { return(x \* (1:10)) } eigs_sym(fmat, 3, n = 10, args = NULL)
From Eigenvalue to SVD An extension to eigenvalue decomposition is the
singular value decomposition (SVD), which works for general rectangular
matrices. Still take PCA as an example. To calculate variable loadings,
we can perform an SVD on the centered data matrix, and the loadings will
be contained in the right singular vectors. This method avoids computing
the covariance matrix, and is generally more stable and accurate than
using cov() and eigen(). Similar to eigs(), rARPACK provides the
function svds() to conduct partial SVD, meaning that only part of the
singular pairs (values and vectors) are to be computed. Below shows an
example that computes the first three PCs of a 2000x500 matrix, and I
compare the timings of three different algorithms:
library(microbenchmark) set.seed(123) \## Some random data x =
matrix(rnorm(2000 \* 500), 2000) pc = function(x, k) { \## First center
data xc = scale(x, center = TRUE, scale = FALSE) \## Partial SVD decomp
= svds(xc, k, nu = 0, nv = k) return(list(loadings = decomp\$v, scores =
xc %\*% decomp\$v)) } microbenchmark(princomp(x), prcomp(x), pc(x, 3),
times = 5) The princomp() and prcomp() functions are the standard
approaches in R to do PCA, which will call eigen() and svd()
respectively. On my machine (Fedora Linux 23, R 3.2.3 with optimized
single-threaded OpenBLAS), the timing results are as follows: Unit:
milliseconds expr min lq mean median uq max neval princomp(x) 274.7621
276.1187 304.3067 288.7990 289.5324 392.3211 5 prcomp(x) 306.4675
391.9723 408.9141 396.8029 397.3183 552.0093 5 pc(x, 3) 162.2127
163.0465 188.3369 163.3839 186.1554 266.8859 5 Applications SVD has some
interesting applications, and one of them is image compression. The
basic idea is to perform a partial SVD on the image matrix, and then
recover it using the calculated singular values and singular vectors.
Below shows an image of size 622x1000: (Orignal image) If we use the
first five singular pairs to recover the image, then we need to store
8115 elements, which is only 1.3% of the original data size. The
recovered image will look like below: (5 singular pairs) Even if the
recovered image is quite blurred, it already reveals the main structure
of the original image. And if we increase the number of singular pairs
to 50, then the difference is almost imperceptible, as is shown below.
(50 singular pairs) There is also a nice Shiny App developed by Nan
Xiao, Yihui Xie and Tong He that allows users to upload an image and
visualize the effect of compression using this algorithm. The code is
available on GitHub. Performance Finally, I would like to use some
benchmark results to show the performance of rARPACK. As far as I know,
there are very few packages available in R that can do the partial
eigenvalue decomposition, so the results here are based on partial SVD.
The first plot compares different SVD functions on a 1000x500 matrix,
with dense format on the left panel, and sparse format on the right. The
second plot shows the results on a 5000x2500 matrix. The functions used
corresponding to the axis labels are as follows: svd: svd() from base R,
which computes the full SVD irlba: irlba() from irlba package, partial
SVD propack, trlan: propack.svd() and trlan.svd() from svd package,
partial SVD svds: svds() from rARPACK The code for benchmark and the
environment to run the code can be found here.

a pretty sophisticated crowd, but not surprisingly, their R skills were

Release 1.4 of the magick package introduces a new feature called image
convolution that was requested by Thomas L. Pedersen. In this post we
explain what this is all about. Kernel Matrix The new image_convolve()
function applies a kernel over the image. Kernel convolution means that
each pixel value is recalculated using the weighted neighborhood sum
defined in the kernel matrix. For example lets look at this simple
kernel: library(magick) kern % image_negate() As with the blurring, the
original image can be blended in with the transformed one, effectively
sharpening the image along edges. img %\>% image_convolve('DoG:0,0,2',
scaling = '100, 100%') The ImageMagick documentation has more examples
of convolve with various avaiable kernels.

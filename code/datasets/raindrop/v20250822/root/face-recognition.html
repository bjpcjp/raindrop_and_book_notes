    <p class="card-excerpt">Research shows that people are quick to form impressions of other people’s social class standing, which can have important consequences – but what specifically drives these impressions, and their relationship to judgements of harmful or advantageous stereotypes, has remained unknown.</p>

    <p class="card-excerpt">**Facial Recognition** is the task of making a positive identification of a face in a photo or video image against a pre-existing database of faces. It begins with detection - distinguishing human faces from other objects in the image - and then works on identification of those detected faces.  The state of the art tables for this task are contained mainly in the consistent parts of the task : the face verification and face identification tasks.

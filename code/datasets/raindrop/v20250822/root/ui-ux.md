</div>

Even though customer experience (CX) leaders are becoming increasingly
focused on optimizing their firms’ customer journeys, they face a clear
challenge: Which touchpoints along the journey should they invest in?
That is, which moments when the customer interacts with their brand are
most impactful to the customer’s overall experience? One way to think of
customer journeys is as continuous patterns of mental experiences traced
over time. Thinking of customer journeys as patterns raises a new set of
productive questions, such as: Which patterns are most successful? And
what features of those patterns lead to success? Some have argued that
the best patterns are smooth and frictionless, while others have made
the case for patterns that fluctuate, given that they are likely to be
more eventful and stimulating. This article covers research and data on
which patterns are most effective, and where CX managers should be
investing their limited resources for the best possible customer
experience outcomes.

</div>

A grid is like invisible glue that holds a design together. Even when
elements are physically separated from each other, something invisible
connects them together. Grids help designers to build better products by
tying different design elements together to achieve effective hierarchy,
alignment and consistency, with little effort. If executed properly,
your designs will appear thoughtful and organized. In this article Nick
Babich aims to give you a good understanding of grid systems, what they
are, and how they can be applied to your design process. Understanding
how to use grids will come from practical experience.

We’re taught to communicate with words. We write essays, prepare
speeches, and take written notes. But words aren’t always the best

ideas using things you can see. In this article, Elizabeth Lin will
explore visual principles, highlight why visual storytelling is a
valuable skill for everyone to learn, and demonstrate how you can
improve your visual storytelling through play.

</div>

Pauline Brown, former chairman of North America for the luxury goods
company LVMH, argues that in additional to traditional and emotional
intelligence, great leaders also need to develop what she calls
aesthetic intelligence. This means knowing what good taste is and
thinking about how your services and products stimulate all five senses
to create delight. Brown argues that in today’s crowded marketplace,
this kind of AI is what will set companies apart — and not just in the
consumer products and luxury sectors. B2B or B2C, small or large,
digital or bricks-and-mortar, all organizations need to hire and train
people to think this way. Brown is the author of the book “Aesthetic
Intelligence: How to Boost It and Use It in Business and Beyond.”

You’re six months into a project when you realize a tiny, simple
assumption you made at the start was completely wrong. And now you need
to fix the problem while keeping the existing system running—with far
more effort than it would’ve taken if you’d just gotten it right in the
first place. Today I’d like to tell you about one common mistake, a
single word that will cause you endless trouble. I am speaking, of
course, about “users”. There are two basic problems with this word:
“User” is almost never a good description of your requirements. “User”
encourages a fundamental security design flaw. The concept “user” is
dangerously vague, and you will almost always be better off using more
accurate terminology.

With so many applications and services and people and machines and

Friedman will talk about privacy-related design patterns. He’ll be
exploring some of the respectful ways to approach privacy and data
collection, and how to deal with those notorious cookie consent prompts,
intrusive push notifications, glorious permission requests, malicious

UX designers use a lot of different research techniques, such as
interviews and workshops. They summarize research findings into user
stories and user flows and communicate their thinking and solutions to
the teams. But somewhere in all of this, there are real people for whom
the products are being designed for. In order to create better products,
designers must understand what’s going on in the user’s world. And
that’s where storyboards come in. In this article, Nick Babich will
focus on storyboards as a means to explore solutions to UX issues, as

Compositional flow determines how the eye is led through a design: where
it looks first, where it looks next, where the eye pauses, and how long
it stays. You have a lot of control over where people look when they’re
viewing a webpage you’ve designed. On a text-heavy and graphic-light
page, a visitor’s eye likely follows something like a Z-pattern or
F-pattern across and down the page. However, as soon as you design page
elements and add graphics, those patterns no longer apply. Your
visitor’s eye will follow the flow, movement and rhythm you create.

Visual direction is the perceived direction of forces acting on and
exerted by elements. A visually heavy element will attract the eye to
it. The direction is a cue to the viewer’s eye to move elsewhere. We
refer to this force as visual weight and to the perceived direction of
visual forces as visual direction. Both are important concepts to
understand if you want to create hierarchy, flow, rhythm and balance in
your composition. Many intrinsic characteristics can be modified to make
an element visually weightier or lighter.

Emphasis is relative. For one element to stand out, another has to serve
as the background from which the first is to stand out. Some elements
need to dominate others in order for your design to display any sort of
visual hierarchy. By varying the visual weight of some elements and the
visual direction of others, you can establish different levels of
dominance. Three levels is ideal; they’re all that most people can
discern. Designing different levels of emphasis or dominance will create
a visual hierarchy in your design, with more important information being
more visually prominent. It will help you communicate with visitors
quickly and efficiently.

Showing that some things are the same and some are different is the
first step in visual communication. It’s the primary way that viewers
derive meaning. Contrast and similarity have different functions. They
are used in varying degree and in combination. You’ll always see some of
both because neither exists without the other. Changing one means also
changing the other. They are clues to design elements. The goal is to
contrast similar layers. The way we structure contrasting and similar
elements creates hierarchy, flow and compositional balance.

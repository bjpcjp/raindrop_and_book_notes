Editor's note: Roman Stanek is CEO and founder of GoodData. Lately, in
Silicon Valley and its counterparts around the world, disappointment has
ruled the halls of companies that had a huge impact with consumers, but
then fizzled as investments when they went public—Facebook’s and Zynga’s
IPOs being the most notorious examples. Attention quickly moved from the
consumer to the enterprise market, where Splunk, Palo Alto Networks,
Workday, and LinkedIn are all humming along just fine. Entrepreneurs
seeking to sell to enterprise customers should recognize that the
business-to-business (B2B) market, especially with respect to IT, plays
by a different set of rules than the business-to-consumer (B2C) space.

The most consistent sales leader I’ve worked with hit plan 27
consecutive quarters. How can a sales leader develop similar
repeatability? Much goes into it here are the reports he used to manage
his team at the board level. The PQR (pipeline-to-quota) funnel is
first. Pipeline is the total value of the accounts within a stage or
later. Quota is the aggregate quota on the street for the quarter.
Divide P by Q to get PQR.

</div>

Profit desert customers — small, low-profit customers often numbering in
the tens of thousands — are an important business segment in most
companies. They often amount to about 50–80% of customers and consume
about 40–60% of the company’s costs. In some companies, they’re assigned
to territory reps as low-revenue “C” accounts, which distracts the reps
from selling more lucrative business. In all companies, they create
costly complexity in functions ranging from order-taking to fulfilment
to after-sales service and returns because these customers are numerous
and often inexperienced. The best way to manage your profit desert
customers is to cluster them under a unified management structure — a
profit desert customer team — rather than having them scattered in sales
reps’ portfolios throughout the company. This team should be composed of
specialized sales and marketing managers who are solely focused on this
customer segment. The author presents three steps these managers should
take to bring latent profits to the bottom line.

</div>

Research shows that 48% of B2B salespeople are afraid of making cold
calls. There are typically two central fears: 1) fear of sounding like a
sales person; and 2) fear of failure. Overcoming the fear of sounding
like a salesperson is a simple matter of accepting that you actually are
a sales professional and that that sales is an honorable profession.
When you dial someone’s phone number or walk into their office, remember
this: You are there to help them improve their lives and businesses.
Until you understand this simple concept, you’re going to be anxious and
fearful about cold calling. Sometimes the fear of cold-calling comes
from a limiting belief that we simply won’t be successful at it, which
creates anxiety and leads to a destructive self-fulfilling prophecy. The
key to getting better at cold-calling is to simply get more accustomed
to it, so your body does not perceive fear. And the best way to do
that?  Role playing. You don’t need to have an Oscar-worthy performance
– you just need to remind your brain that there’s nothing to be afraid
of. The more accustomed you get to cold-calling, the more confident
you’ll be, which creates a more productive, positive, self-fulfilling
prophecy.

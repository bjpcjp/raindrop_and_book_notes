</div>

Some NDAs illegally place restrictions on an employee’s ability to
report misconduct to government agencies like the U.S. Department of
Labor (DOL) or the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
Securities violations, including fraud, insider trading, and market
manipulation, are some of the most common forms of misconduct that
companies try to prevent employees from reporting. If you ever find
yourself in this sticky spot — having signed an NDA that restricts you
from blowing the whistle on a securities violation at work — it’s
important to know your rights. Most importantly, restrictive NDAs are
illegal and you can report misconduct (and an illegal NDA)
confidentially to the SEC.

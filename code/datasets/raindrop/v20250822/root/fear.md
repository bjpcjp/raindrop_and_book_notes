Treating anxiety, depression and other disorders may depend on the
amygdala, a part of the brain that controls strong emotional reactions,
especially fear. But a deep understanding of this structure has been
lacking. Now scientists at the University of California, Davis have
identified new clusters of cells with differing patterns of gene
expression in the amygdala of humans and non-human primates. The work
could lead to more targeted treatments for disorders such as anxiety
that affect tens of millions of people.

Are babies oblivious to danger? It's not that simple, says cognitive
scientist Shari Liu. Sharing surprising insights (and plenty of baby
videos) from studies of early human development, Liu highlights the
unexpected ways babies perceive and respond to risky situations — and
what these findings could unravel about the inner workings of our minds.

All fears can be divided into four broad categories which psychologists
refer to as the four horsemen of fear: bodily, interpersonal, cognitive
and behavioral fears. And each of the four horsemen of fear can be
addressed by applying simple strategies.

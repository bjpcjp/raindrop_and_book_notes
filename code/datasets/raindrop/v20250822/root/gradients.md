Neural Networks learn to predict by backpropagation. This article aims
to help you, build a solid intuition about the concept using a simple
example. The ideas we learn here can be expanded for bigger nerual
network. I assume that you already know how feed forward neural network
works. Before reading the article further, take a pen and paper. The
calculation used in this article can be done in the head. But I still
want you to do by hand.

Exploding gradients are a problem where large error gradients accumulate
and result in very large updates to neural network model weights during
training. This has the effect of your model being unstable and unable to
learn from your training data. In this post, you will discover the
problem of exploding gradients with deep artificial neural networks.
After completing this post,…

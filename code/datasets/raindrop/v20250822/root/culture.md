</div>

Innovative cultures are generally depicted as pretty fun. They’re
characterized by a tolerance for failure and a willingness to
experiment. They’re seen as being psychologically safe, highly
collaborative, and nonhierarchical. And research suggests that these
behaviors translate into better innovative performance. But despite the
fact that innovative cultures are desirable, and that most leaders claim
to understand what they entail, they are hard to create and sustain.
That’s because the easy-to-like behaviors that get so much attention are
only one side of the coin. They must be counterbalanced by some tougher
and frankly less fun behaviors: an intolerance for incompetence,
rigorous discipline, brutal candor, a high level of individual
accountability, and strong leadership. Unless the tensions created by
this paradox are carefully managed, attempts to create an innovative
culture will fail.

</div>

Leadership has traditionally been taught as a set of larger actions,
such as having a difficult conversation or coaching someone. In reality,
leading well is an integrated activity, in which one is doing many
things simultaneously. One way to learn to do this better is to think
about leadership as a series of small actions that are practiced, then
carefully sequenced and interwoven during interactions. For instance,
instead of thinking of something as a “difficult conversation,” a leader
might aim to disarm, then show appreciation, then appeal to values.
Research identifies 25 such actions, and learning to implement them in
the right circumstances can help one become a better leader.

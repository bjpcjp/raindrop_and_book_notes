New research reveals open-source AI models use up to 10 times more
computing resources than closed alternatives, potentially negating cost
advantages for enterprise deployments.

The top open source Large Language Models available for commercial use
are as follows. Llama - 2 Meta released Llama 2, a set of pretrained and
refined LLMs, along with Llama 2-Chat, a version of Llama 2. These
models are scalable up to 70 billion parameters. It was discovered after
extensive testing on safety and helpfulness-focused benchmarks that
Llama 2-Chat models perform better than current open-source models in
most cases. Human evaluations have shown that they align well with
several closed-source models.  The researchers have even taken a few
steps to guarantee the security of these models. This includes
annotating

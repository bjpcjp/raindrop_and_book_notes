</div>

As global consumers grow increasingly conscious of the environmental
toll of plastic packaging, many brands have taken steps to reduce their
use of plastic. But at the same time, some brands have adopted a much
less productive approach to the anti-plastic movement: They’ve begun
adding superfluous paper packaging on top of plastic packaging in order
to make their products look more environmentally friendly without
actually reducing plastic waste. The authors’ research demonstrates that
this sort of overpackaging can indeed be effective in boosting
consumers’ perceptions of sustainability, despite the fact that it is
demonstrably worse for the environment (not to mention more expensive
for manufacturers). However, they also found that simply adding a
“minimal packaging” label to plastic packages can reduce the
misperception that overpackaged products are more sustainable, enabling
brands to attract environmentally-conscious consumers without creating
unnecessary paper waste.

The Dunning-Kruger effect can be observed during talent shows like
American Idol. The auditions are usually filled with a variety of good
and bad singers. The ones who are bad at it, almost never realize how
bad they really are. Low ability people do not possess the skills needed
to recognize their own incompetence or lack of knowledge. Their poor
self-awareness leads them to overestimate their own capabilities.
However when you become more knowledgeable about a certain topic, that
confidence falls. Only when you start to reach above average skill, is
when the your confidence about a certain topic starts to pick up again.
But why? Why does being less skilled make you more confident in your
abilities? Images © Piers Baker www.svgdoodlewhiteboard.com

How does risky behavior spread? There are two theories: one involving
social cues and the other involving trial-and-error. Covid-19 offered a
chance to study this phenomenon and found evidence for both. In
particular, the authors’ research documents a phenomenon of “risk
creep,” where lucky near-misses (not getting Covid) encourage people to
take riskier behavior in the future.

If your team feels “stuck,” the problem might involve issues that are
difficult to discuss — conflict between two team members, for example,
or an underperforming employee. To address these issues head-on, leaders
must learn the art of framing a conversation so people can organize
their thoughts, feelings, and experiences to come to a solution. This
article offers a five-step process around framing, and two examples of
how it can help bring “undiscussables” into the light.

MIT neuroscientists have identified a brain circuit that helps us to
filter out unwanted background noise or other distracting sensory
stimuli. When this circuit is engaged, the prefrontal cortex selectively
suppresses sensory input as it flows into the thalamus, the site where
most sensory information enters the brain.

</div>

Most of us have been “feedsmacked” at some point in our life. In the
midst of a meeting, an innocent walk down the hallway, or a performance
review, someone delivers a verbal wallop that rocks us to our
psychological footings. These situations are so tough to handle because
we all have two fundamental psychological needs: safety (perceived
physical, social, or material security) and worth (a sense of
self-respect, self-regard or self-confidence). Critical feedback feels
traumatic because it’s often interpreted as a threat to these needs.
Fortunately, there are four skills that will help you reduce the
perceived threat in the moment. First, collect yourself. You might
breathe deeply and slowly or notice your feelings. Then, seek to
understand the feedback. Ask questions. Ask for examples. Get curious.
Next, take the time you need to recover before you evaluate the
feedback. Lastly, examine what you were told, scouring for the kernels
of truth. That’s where the learning and development comes from. Being
caught off-guard with feedback isn’t fun, but it doesn’t have to be
traumatic if you use these four skills.

When you join a new organization, it’s important to understand who holds
the power because they directly impact how work gets done, but it’s not
always perfectly clear. In this piece, the author offers strategies to
better identify where the true power exists.  “At first glance across
your company, it’s natural to assume that those who have ‘chief’ or
‘senior’ in their titles are the ones that dominate the power
landscape,” the author writes. “But this isn’t always the case.”

</div>

Employees rightly expect to be able to bring their feelings — big and
small — to work. One important way to provide that support is through
rituals. The author defines rituals using two important benchmarks.
First, rituals go beyond their practical purpose, moving participants
beyond transaction and into meaning. For instance, lighting a candle
when the lights go out isn’t a ritual, but turning off the lights and
lighting a candle at sundown is. Second, rituals are sorely missed when
they’re taken away. The author presents a case study from a company that
took a risk in real time and created a successful response to a tragedy,
and over time, that response became a ritual. Here’s how they did it,
and how leaders can better understand their own rituals — both current
ones and those that have yet to be discovered.

“I’ve probably revised this investor pitch deck 200 times,” a founder
told me recently. She’d met with more than 50 potential investors before
closing a seed round last month. This might sound excessive to some, but
her experience is not unusual. Entrepreneurs often spend hundreds of

these activities are clearly important, analysis of new data on startups
suggests that founders should also dedicate significant time to
something that many people overlook: recruiting great mentors. This
simple strategy can increase a company’s odds of success more than
almost anything else.

[Managing the

Reprint: R1405G Even in an age of relentless self-promotion, some
extremely capable professionals prefer to avoid the spotlight.
“Invisibles” work in fields ranging from engineering to interpreting to
perfumery, but they have three things in common: They are ambivalent
about recognition, seeing any time spent courting fame as time taken
away from the work at hand. They are meticulous. And they savor
responsibility, viewing even high pressure as an honor and a source of
fascination. Something else unites Invisibles: They represent a
management challenge. The usual carrots don’t motivate them; however,
managers can take several steps to ensure their satisfaction. Leaders
should recognize who their Invisibles are; decide if they want more
Invisibles on the team; reward them fairly, soliciting reports on their
accomplishments; make the work more intrinisically interesting; and talk
to the Invisibles about what works best for them. These actions are well
worth taking, as Invisibles not only bring exceptional levels of
achievement to an organization but quietly improve the work of those
around them, elevating performance and tone across the board.

</div>

We all know that leaders need vision and energy, but after an exhaustive
review of the most influential theories on leadership–as well as
workshops with thousands of leaders and aspiring leaders–the authors
learned that great leaders also share four unexpected qualities. The
first quality of exceptional leaders is that they selectively reveal
their weaknesses (weaknesses, not fatal flaws). Doing so lets employees
see that they are approachable. It builds an atmosphere of trust and
helps galvanize commitment. The second quality of inspirational leaders
is their heavy reliance on intuition to gauge the appropriate timing and
course of their actions. Such leaders are good “situation sensors”–they
can sense what’s going on without having things spelled out for them.
Managing employees with “tough empathy” is the third quality of
exceptional leadership. Tough empathy means giving people what they
need, not what they want. Leaders must empathize passionately and
realistically with employees, care intensely about the work they do, and
be straightforward with them. The fourth quality of top-notch leaders is
that they capitalize on their differences. They use what’s unique about
themselves to create a social distance and to signal separateness, which
in turn motivates employees to perform better. All four qualities are
necessary for inspirational leadership, but they cannot be used
mechanically; they must be mixed and matched to meet the demands of
particular situations. Most important, however, is that the qualities
encourage authenticity among leaders. To be a true leader, the authors
advise, “Be yourself–more–with skill.”

How do you make decisions? If you're like most people, you'll probably
answer that you pride yourself on weighing the pros and cons of a
situation carefully and then make a decision based on logic. You know
that other people have weak personalities and are easily swayed by their
emotions, but this rarely happens to you. You've just experienced the
\[fundamental attribution
error\](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_attribution_error) —
the tendency to believe that other people's behaviour is due to their
personality (“Josh is late because he's a disorganised person”) whereas
our behaviour is due to external circumstances (“I'm late because the
directions were useless”). Cognitive biases like these play a
significant role in the way we make decisions so it's not surprising
that people are now examining these biases \*\*to see how to exploit
them in the design of web sites\*\*. I'm going to use the term
‘persuasion architects' to describe designers who knowingly use these
techniques to influence the behaviour of users. (Many skilled designers
already use some of these psychological techniques intuitively — but
they wouldn't be able to articulate why they have made a particular
design choice. The difference between these designers and persuasion
architects is that persuasion architects use these techniques
intentionally).

</div>

People, including negotiators, lie every day, so when you’re trying to
make a deal, it’s important to defend against deception. The best
strategy, says the author, is to focus not on detecting lies but on
preventing them. She outlines five tactics that research has shown to be
effective: Encourage reciprocity. You can build trust and prompt other
parties to disclose strategic information by sharing information
yourself. Ask the right questions. Negotiators often lie by omission,
keeping mum about relevant facts, but if directly asked, they are more
likely to respond honestly. Watch for dodging. Don’t let your
counterparts sidestep your questions—write them down in advance, take
notes on the answers, and make sure you get the information you’re
seeking. Don’t dwell on confidentiality. Studies show that the more you
reassure others that you’ll protect their privacy, the more guarded and
apt to lie they become. So be nonchalant when discussing sensitive
topics. Cultivate leaks. People often reveal information unwittingly, so
listen carefully for any slips and try indirect approaches to gaining
information.

</div>

To go above and beyond expectations when completing a given
task/project. A genericized phrase originally used within the animation
industry and the film industry as a whole. Based on a scene from the
1988 mixed live-action/animated film 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit' in which
the main live-action character, Eddie Valiant, bumps into a ceiling lamp
whilst handcuffed to the main animated character, Roger Rabbit, causing
the lamp to continually swing back and forth throughout the remainder of
the scene. The term refers to how the animators went on to meticulously
hand-draw unique shadows for the animated character for every frame of
the scene. The phrase went on to become a company mythos for the Walt
Disney Company, then as a guiding principle within the greater film
industry, and now sees use generally.

</div>

The ability to get issues on the table and work through them
constructively is critical to having a healthy culture. Managers can
normalize productive conflict on your team by using an exercise to map
out the unique value of each role and the tensions that should exist
among them. Draw a circle and divide that circle into enough wedges to
represent each role on your team. For each role, ask: What is the unique
value of this role on this team? On which stakeholders is this role
focused? What is the most common tension this role puts on team
discussions? Answer those questions for each member of the team, filling
in the wedges with the answers. As you go, emphasize how the different
roles are supposed to be in tension with one another. With heightened
awareness and a shared language, your team will start to realize that
much of what they have been interpreting as interpersonal friction has
actually been perfectly healthy role-based tension.

What does it take to become a more convincing communicator? New research
suggests that linguistic mirroring — that is, adjusting your
communication style to match that of your audience — is an effective
tool to increase your ability to influence others. In this piece, the
authors describe four key dimensions of linguistic mirroring, as well as
several tactical strategies for leaders looking to win over a client,
judge, or other important evaluator. Ultimately, they argue that
building genuine relationships with key evaluators is the best way to
gain insight into their linguistic preferences — but it’s up to all of
us to make sure that we use the power of linguistic mirroring for good.

</div>

It’s important to understand that when you, as a leader, communicate
with your team, using weaker words weakens your message and blunts your
ability to inspire people. It’s not enough to just throw thoughts out
there and hope for the best. You need to actively recommend ideas and
assert their worthiness in all of your communications. For example,
consider these “power words”: “I’m proposing (not “sharing”) an idea
that will make our process more efficient.” “I’m suggesting (not
“sharing”) a new logo that better conveys our brand message.” “I’m
recommending (not “sharing”) a campaign to make our workplace more
diverse.” Ultimately, audiences respond more actively to big points than
to small words, but thoughtful leaders need to assess both, knowing that
the more powerfully they come across — even in small ways — the greater
impact they have on the people they hope to inspire.

We live in an age of polarization. Many of us may be asking ourselves
how, when people disagree with or discount us, we can persuade them to
rethink their positions. The author, an organizational psychologist, has
spent time with a number of people who succeeded in motivating the
notoriously self-confident Steve Jobs to change his mind and has
analyzed the science behind their techniques. Some leaders are so sure
of themselves that they reject good opinions and ideas from others and
refuse to abandon their own bad ones. But, he writes, “it is possible to
get even the most overconfident, stubborn, narcissistic, and
disagreeable people to open their minds.” He offers some approaches that
can help you encourage a know-it-all to recognize when there’s something
to be learned, a stubborn colleague to make a U-turn, a narcissist to
show humility, and a disagreeable boss to agree with you.

involved in a negotiation, ask yourself if the solution being proposed
will cause a loss of face for anyone, and work to help avoid that.

[The Elements of Good

</div>

Judgment—the ability to combine personal qualities with relevant
knowledge and experience to form opinions and make decisions—is “the
core of exemplary leadership,” according to Noel Tichy and Warren Bennis
(the authors of Judgment: How Winning Leaders Make Great Calls). It is
what enables a sound choice in the absence of clear-cut, relevant data
or an obvious path. Likierman believes that a more precise understanding
of what exactly gives someone good judgment may make it possible for
people to learn and improve on it. He approached CEOs at a range of
companies, from some of the world’s largest right down to start-ups,
along with leaders in the professions: senior partners at law and
accountancy firms, generals, doctors, scientists, priests, and
diplomats. He asked them to share their observations of their own and
other people’s exercise of judgment so that he could identify the skills
and behaviors that collectively create the conditions for fresh insights
and enable decision makers to discern patterns that others miss. As a
result, he has identified six key elements that collectively constitute
good judgment: learning, trust, experience, detachment, options, and
delivery. He describes these elements and offers suggestions for
improvement in each one.

More than 2,000 years ago Aristotle outlined a formula on how to become
a master of persuasion in his work Rhetoric . To successfully sell your
next idea, try using these five rhetorical devices that he identified in
your next speech or presentation: The first is egos or “character.” In
order for your audience to trust you, start your talk by establishing
your credibility. Then, make a logical appeal to reason, or “logos.” Use
data, evidence, and facts to support your pitch. The third device, and
perhaps the most important, is “pathos,” or emotion. People are moved to
action by how a speaker makes them feel. Aristotle believed the best way
to transfer emotion from one person to another is through storytelling.
The more personal your content is the more your audience will feel
connected to you and your idea.

</div>

Why do issues remain open secrets in organizations, where multiple
employees know about a problem or a concern, but no one publicly brings
it up? Researchers recently explored this in a set of studies. They
found that as issues become more common knowledge among frontline
employees, the willingness of any individual employee to bring those
issues to the attention of the top-management decreased. Instead of
speaking up, what they observed among their participants was something
like the bystander effect, a psychological phenomena describing how
people stay on the sidelines as passive bystanders, waiting for others
to act rather than do something themselves. If managers want to avoid
the bystander effect so that problems don’t go unresolved, they should
tell employees that their voices are not redundant and that they need to
share their opinions even if others have the same information.

[How to Overcome Your Fear of

</div>

People are quick to blame themselves for failure. But not doing
something because you’re afraid to get started isn’t going to help you
grow. Here are four strategies to help you get over the hump. Start by
redefining what failure means to you. If you define failure as the
discrepancy between what you hope to achieve (such as getting a job
offer) and what you might achieve (learning from the experience), you
can focus on what you learned, which helps you recalibrate for future
challenges. It’s also important to set approach goals instead of
avoidance goals: focus on what you want to achieve rather than what you
want to avoid. Creating a “fear list” can also help. This is a list of
what may not happen as a result of your fear — the cost of inaction. And
finally, focus on learning. The chips aren’t always going to fall where
you want them to — but if you expect that reality going into an event,
you can be prepared to wring the most value out of whatever outcome.

A Veblen good is a type of luxury good, named after American economist
Thorstein Veblen, for which the demand increases as the price increases,
in apparent contradiction of the law of demand, resulting in an
upward-sloping demand curve. The higher prices of Veblen goods may make
them desirable as a status symbol in the practices of conspicuous
consumption and conspicuous leisure. A product may be a Veblen good
because it is a positional good, something few others can own.

A recent EY survey found that more than 40% of U.S. respondents reported
feeling physically and emotionally isolated in the workplace. This group
spanned generations, genders and ethnicities. People want more
connection with those they work with. So how can companies connect more
effectively with employees and help them feel like they belong within
their workplace community? The survey points to one simple solution:
establish more opportunities for colleagues to check in with one
another. 39% of respondents feel the greatest sense of belonging when
their colleagues check in with them, both personally and professionally.
By reaching out and acknowledging their employees on a personal level,
companies and leaders can significantly enhance the employee experience
by making their people feel valued and connected.

</div>

As a leader, you want the people in your organization to trust you. And
with good reason. In our coaching with leaders, we often see that trust
is a leading indicator of whether others evaluate them positively or
negatively. But how to create that trust, or perhaps more importantly,
how reestablish it when you’ve lost it isn’t always that
straightforward. By analyzing over 80,000 360-degree reviews, the
authors found that there are three elements that predict whether a
leader will be trusted by his direct reports, peers, and other
colleagues. These are positive relationships, consistency, and good
judgment/expertise. When a leader was above average on each of these
elements, they were more likely to be trusted, and positive
relationships appeared to be the most important element in that, without
it, a leader’s trust rating fell most significantly. Trust is an
important currency in organizations and any leader would be wise to
invest time in building it by focusing on these three elements.

When people are rude, our ego demands we respond in kind with a quick
comeback or snide remark. If we give in, we might feel better in the

</div>

An analysis of more than 1.2 million records of internal reports made by
employees of public U.S. companies reveals that whistleblowers are
crucial to keeping firms healthy. The more employees use internal
whistleblowing hotlines, the fewer lawsuits companies face, and the less
money firms pay out in settlements. A one standard deviation increase in
the use of an internal reporting system is associated with 6.9% fewer
pending lawsuits and 20.4% less in aggregate settlement amounts over a
three-year period.

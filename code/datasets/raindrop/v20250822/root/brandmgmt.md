Pauline Brown, former chairman of North America for the luxury goods
company LVMH, argues that in additional to traditional and emotional
intelligence, great leaders also need to develop what she calls
aesthetic intelligence. This means knowing what good taste is and
thinking about how your services and products stimulate all five senses
to create delight. Brown argues that in today’s crowded marketplace,
this kind of AI is what will set companies apart — and not just in the
consumer products and luxury sectors. B2B or B2C, small or large,
digital or bricks-and-mortar, all organizations need to hire and train
people to think this way. Brown is the author of the book “Aesthetic
Intelligence: How to Boost It and Use It in Business and Beyond.”

[The Most Effective Price Discovery Question for Your Startup by
@ttunguz](http://tomtunguz.com/price-discovery)

Pricing is one of the most challenging decisions for any startup. One of
the simplest ways of discovering customer willingness to pay is simply
to ask them. At first blush, that might seem a reasonable and effective
solution, it is prone to wild inaccuracy. Absolute pricing judgments are
hard without reference points. For example: How much would you be
willing to pay for a new iPhone? It’s a very challenging question to
answer in the abstract.

‘The Problem with…’ series covers controversial topics related to
efforts to improve healthcare quality, including widely recommended but
deceptively difficult strategies for improvement and pervasive problems
that seem to resist solution. The ‘5 whys’ technique is one of the most
widely taught approaches to root-cause analysis (RCA) in healthcare. Its
use is promoted by the WHO,1 the English National Health Service,2 the
Institute for Healthcare Improvement,3 the Joint Commission4 and many
other organisations in the field of healthcare quality and safety. Like
most such tools, though, its popularity is not the result of any
evidence that it is effective.5–8 Instead, it probably owes its place in
the curriculum and practice of RCA to a combination of pedigree,
simplicity and pedagogy. In terms of pedigree, ‘5 whys’ traces its roots
back to the Toyota Production System (TPS).9 It also plays a key role in
Lean10 (a generic version of TPS) as well as Six Sigma,11 another
popular quality improvement (QI) methodology. Taiichi Ohno describes ‘5
whys’ as central to the TPS methodology:The basis of Toyota's scientific
approach is to ask why five times whenever we find a problem … By
repeating why five times, the nature of the problem as well as its
solution becomes clear. The solution, or the how-to, is designated as
‘1H.’ Thus, ‘Five whys equal one how’ (5W=1H). (ref. 9, p. 123) This
quote also makes the case for the technique's simplicity. Asking ‘why’
five times allows users to arrive at a single root cause that might not
have been obvious at the outset. It may also inspire a single solution
to address that root cause (though it is not clear that the ‘1H’ side of
the equation has been adopted as widely). The pedagogical argument for …

[Sometimes It’s Not the Change They Hate — Users

There has been a lot of discussion in the design world recently about
"change aversion." Most of the articles about it seem to be targeting
the new Google redesign, but I've certainly seen this same discussion
happen at many companies when big changes aren't universally embraced by
users.

If you are building a product, you should always speak with customers
and test your idea before. But you probably don’t know that \*you
\*might be making some of the most common mistakes when running your
experiments. Mistakes include testing the wrong aspect of your business,
asking the wrong questions and neglecting to define a criterion for
success. In this article, Grace Ng will show you a guide to designing

[5 Questions Every Manager Needs to Ask Their Direct

</div>

If you’re worried that your employees are eyeing the door, it’s time to
start having some important career-defining conversations. In this
piece, executive coach Susan Peppercorn outlines five questions to start
asking your direct reports so that you can get a better sense of how
they’re feeling about their positions: 1) How would you like to grow
within this organization? 2) Do you feel a sense of purpose in your job?
3) What do you need from me to do your best work? 4) What are we
currently not doing as a company that you feel we should do? 5) Do you
have the opportunity to do what you do best every day? When managers
make checking in with these five questions a regular part of how they
interact with their employees, it helps ensure that people feel seen and
valued. And when managers help individuals on their teams feel that way,
they’re more likely to be rewarded by employees who become advocates for
the department and organization, no matter how long they stay.

Almost exactly a year ago, I started a little boutique software company
called Report Card Writer. As the name suggests, my flagship software
product does pretty much one thing: it helps teachers write report card
comments faster. Its core technical functionality is part survey form,
part template-filler-inner, with a few extra bolt-on features that make
it easy to create and populate the form and template, respectively.

Neuromorphic computing represents a transformative approach to
artificial intelligence, seeking to emulate the human brain's neural
structures and processing methods. This computing paradigm offers
significant advancements in efficiency and performance for specific
tasks, including those requiring real-time processing and low power
consumption. Here, we explore the algorithms that drive neuromorphic
computing, its potential use cases, and its diverse applications.
Algorithms in Neuromorphic Computing Neuromorphic computing leverages
unique algorithms to mimic neurobiological architectures inherent to the
nervous system. Key algorithms include: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs):
Unlike traditional neural networks, which process continuous data, SNNs
manage binary events or 'spikes.' They are

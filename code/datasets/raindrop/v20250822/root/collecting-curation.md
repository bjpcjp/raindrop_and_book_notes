We’ve all watched from the sidelines as companies have come out in a
burst of glory, and then, two years later, spent their venture capital,
lost their user base, and failed to monetize. This begs the question -
what are the factors that drive a company’s survival, differentiate it,
and ultimately make it a winner? In today’s online world,
personalization is increasingly making or breaking companies. The
companies that win are the ones making personalization a key company
value – not just a feature. In the early days of the web, consumers were
happy just to gain access to information. However, as technology became
more sophisticated, and as more consumers and companies came online, we
quickly moved out of the access age and into a state of information
overload, often leaving consumers frustrated and confused. Companies
that helped consumers cut through the clutter to reveal relevant
information had a critical and sustainable competitive advantage in
their respective areas. The concept of relevance is critical to the
success of Google, for example.

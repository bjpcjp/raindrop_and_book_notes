Every website or PWA you build should automate as much prospecting and
selling as possible. The only thing is that visitors enter websites with
various mindsets, depending on which part of the buying stage they’re
at. This means that you can’t just take every person who enters the site
through the same path. You have to design a custom sales funnel (or
pathway) for each kind of buyer. In this article, Suzanna Scacca will
tell you what you need to keep in mind.

Researchers have shrunk state-of-the-art computer vision models to run
on low-power devices. Growing pains: Visual recognition is deep
learning’s strongest skill. Computer vision algorithms are analyzing
medical images, enabling self-driving cars, and powering face
recognition. But training models to recognize actions in videos has
grown increasingly expensive. This has fueled concerns about the
technology’s carbon…

In my experience, there are a few "cuts" of data that matter more for
mobile than for desktop. Conversely, there are a handful of traditional
metrics from desktops that are not as important on mobile or potentially

[Introduction to Google Cloud
Functions](https://ncona.com/2020/11/introduction-to-google-cloud-functions)

</div>

Cloud Functions are Google’s offering for serverless architecture
(similar to AWS lambdas). What is serverless? Before we look into how to
use Cloud Functions, we should understand some things about it. Code
needs servers to run, so serverless doesn’t mean there are no servers,
it means that we don’t need to manage those servers ourselves. In a
usual server based architecture, we might create a service and deploy it
to a machine. This service will be running in the machine all the time
waiting for requests. This has the disadvantage that even if there are
no requests, the machine would need to be up, and incurring cost. On the
other hand, if we use Cloud Functions, we write a service and register
it with Google. Google will then listen to the endpoint this service
cares about and will only start it when there are requests. If it
detects that there haven’t been requests for some time, it will stop the
service again.

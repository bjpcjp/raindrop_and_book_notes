[5 Questions Every Manager Needs to Ask Their Direct

</div>

If you’re worried that your employees are eyeing the door, it’s time to
start having some important career-defining conversations. In this
piece, executive coach Susan Peppercorn outlines five questions to start
asking your direct reports so that you can get a better sense of how
they’re feeling about their positions: 1) How would you like to grow
within this organization? 2) Do you feel a sense of purpose in your job?
3) What do you need from me to do your best work? 4) What are we
currently not doing as a company that you feel we should do? 5) Do you
have the opportunity to do what you do best every day? When managers
make checking in with these five questions a regular part of how they
interact with their employees, it helps ensure that people feel seen and
valued. And when managers help individuals on their teams feel that way,
they’re more likely to be rewarded by employees who become advocates for
the department and organization, no matter how long they stay.

[Why I Encourage My Best Employees to Consider Outside Job

</div>

Most bosses live in fear that their best employees will leave, so it
might seem to be a bad idea to encourage your stars to consider outside
offers. But in fact, it sends employees a clear signal that you really
care about their learning and development. Openness allows for an honest
conversation between you and each employee about their future career
path. If they do decide to leave, they’ll be more likely to recommend
you as a great boss, and also more likely to return at some future
point.

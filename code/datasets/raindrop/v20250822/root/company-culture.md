A few years ago, Google decided to research what was the key ingredient
that made some software teams at the company more successful than
others. Much to their surprise the key trait that was most correlated
with successful teams wasn’t technical prowess, personalities or the
educational background of the team members. Instead it was the notion of
psychological safety — “ a shared belief held by members of a team that
the team is safe for interpersonal risk-taking.’’

</div>

Innovative cultures are generally depicted as pretty fun. They’re
characterized by a tolerance for failure and a willingness to
experiment. They’re seen as being psychologically safe, highly
collaborative, and nonhierarchical. And research suggests that these
behaviors translate into better innovative performance. But despite the
fact that innovative cultures are desirable, and that most leaders claim
to understand what they entail, they are hard to create and sustain.
That’s because the easy-to-like behaviors that get so much attention are
only one side of the coin. They must be counterbalanced by some tougher
and frankly less fun behaviors: an intolerance for incompetence,
rigorous discipline, brutal candor, a high level of individual
accountability, and strong leadership. Unless the tensions created by
this paradox are carefully managed, attempts to create an innovative
culture will fail.

</div>

The Divine Comedy is an Italian narrative poem by Dante Alighieri, begun
c. 1308 and completed around 1321, shortly before the author's death. It
is widely considered the pre-eminent work in Italian literature and one
of the greatest works of Western literature. The poem's imaginative
vision of the afterlife is representative of the medieval worldview as
it existed in the Western Church by the 14th century. It helped
establish the Tuscan language, in which it is written, as the
standardized Italian language. It is divided into three parts: Inferno,
Purgatorio, and Paradiso.

</div>

Chekhov's gun is a narrative principle that states that every element in
a story must be necessary and irrelevant elements should be removed. For
example, if a writer features a gun in a story, there must be a reason
for it, such as it being fired some time later in the plot. All elements
must eventually come into play at some point in the story. Some authors,
such as Hemingway, do not agree with this principle.

Learning how to write a short story is the perfect place to begin your
writing journey. But it's an art—they're vastly different from
full-length novels.

Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, before he became short-hand for a
filmmaker cursed with cosmically bad luck, before he became the sole
American member of seminal British comedy group Monty Python, Terry
Gilliam made a name for himself creating odd animated bits for the UK
series Do Not Adjust Your Set.

'Great literature is one of two stories,' we often quote Leo Tolstoy as
saying: 'a man goes on a journey or a stranger comes to town.' That's
all well and good for the author of War and Peace, but what about the
thousands of screenwriters struggling to come up with the next hit
movie, the next hit television series, the next hit platform-specific
web and/or mobile series?

We have grown very used to the idea of time travel, as explored and
exploited in so many movies and TV series and so much fiction. Although
it feels like it’s been around forever, it isn’t an ancient archetypal
story but a newborn myth, created by H.G. Wells in his 1895 novel The
Time Machine. To put it another way, time travel is two years older than
Dracula, and eight years younger than Sherlock Holmes.

Claudia Dreifus: You are sometimes called “the Balzac of Baltimore.”
What’s your take on the title? David Simon: When people say that, I go,
“Did you just call me a ball sac?” I usually goof on that. I haven’t
read all of Balzac. I keep slicing up society, taking a different slice
each time, thinking, eventually I’ll have a cake. That’s Balzac. That’s
what he did. What I never do is raise my hand and say, “This could be a
hit. Make this because this could be a hit.” The minute I do that, I’m
done as me.

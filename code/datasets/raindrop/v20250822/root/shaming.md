us. Although such a person is not described in the psychiatric
literature, I describe his/her principal elements here.

[Shamelessness as a strategy](https://nadia.xyz/shameless)

I’ve enjoyed playing a game called Avalon recently. I won’t go too far
into the rules, but it’s a hidden role game in the vein of Secret Hitler
or Werewolf, where one team is “good”, trying to uncover who among them
is “evil”, before the evil team wins.

</div>

Consumers are more likely to buy embarrassing products when their
embarrassment is mitigated by more-anonymous packaging. Specifically,
consumers found products packaged in boxes with cool colors, small
lettering, and a picture of the product to be more anonymous (and
appealing) than products packaged in pumps or tubes with warm colors,
medium or large lettering, and no picture. The findings show that the
more anonymous a product looks, the less embarrassing a consumer finds
it, and the more likely they are to purchase it.

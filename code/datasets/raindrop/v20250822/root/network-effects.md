Network effects are one of the most important dynamics in software and
marketplace businesses. But they’re often spoken of in a binary way:
either you have them, or you don’t. In practice, most companies’ network
effects are much more complex, falling along a spectrum of different
types and strengths. They’re also dynamic and evolve as...

This post is all about network effects and critical mass. But it’s also
about applying those concepts as important mental models in business, so
I will share a short story about a business decision I once made that
required me to consider network effects.   The Internet bubble had
popped by 2002, and a lot...

In the furiously competitive world of tech startups, where good
entrepreneurs tend to think of comparable ideas around the same time and
"hot spaces" get crowded quickly with well-funded hopefuls, competitive
moats matter more than ever.  Ideally, as your startup scales, you want

In many ways, online marketplaces are the perfect business model. Since
they facilitate transactions between independent suppliers and customers
rather than take possession of and responsibility for the products or
services in question, they have inherently low cost structures and fat
gross margins. They are highly defensible once established, owing to
network effects. Yet online marketplaces remain extremely difficult to
build, say Andrei Hagiu of Harvard Business School and venture
capitalist Simon Rothman of Greylock Partners. Most entrepreneurs and
investors attribute this to the challenge of quickly attracting a
critical mass of buyers and suppliers. But it is wrong to assume that
once a marketplace has overcome this hurdle, the sailing will be smooth.
Several other important pitfalls can threaten marketplaces: growing too
fast too early; failing to foster sufficient trust and safety; resorting
to sticks, rather than carrots, to deter user disintermediation; and
ignoring the risks of regulation. This article draws on company examples
such as eBay, Lending Club, and Airbnb to offer practical advice for
avoiding those hazards.

Credit where it's definitely due: this post was inspired by a Twitter
conversation with Box CEO Aaron Levie. Don't look now, but something
remarkable is happening. Instagram had twelve employees when it was
purchased for \$700 million; all of its actual computing power was
outsourced to Amazon Web Services. Mighty ARM has only 2300 employees,
but there are more than 35 billion ARM-based chips out there. They do no
manufacturing; instead they license their designs to companies like
Apple, who in turn contract with companies like TSMC for the actual
fabrication. Nest Labs and Ubiquiti are both 200-employee hardware
companies worth circa \$1 billion...who subcontract their actual
manufacturing out to China.

Editor’s Note: Nir Eyal blogs about the intersection of psychology,
technology, and business at NirAndFar.com. Sangeet Paul Choudary
analyzes business models for network businesses at Platformed.info.
Traditionally defined as a system where each new user on the network
increases the value of the service for all others, a network effect
often creates a winner-takes-all dynamic, ordaining one dominant company
above the rest.

protects their margins and profits from competitors over long periods of

The most successful companies and products of the internet era have all
been predicated on the concept of network effects, where the network
becomes more valuable to users as more people use it. This is as true of
companies like Amazon and Google as it is for open source projects like
Wikipedia and some cryptocurrencies....

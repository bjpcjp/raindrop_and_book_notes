Designing neuromorphic sensory processing units (NSPUs) based on
Temporal Neural Networks (TNNs) is a highly challenging task due to the
reliance on manual, labor-intensive hardware development processes. TNNs
have been identified as highly promising for real-time edge AI
applications, mainly because they are energy-efficient and bio-inspired.
However, available methodologies lack automation and are not very
accessible. Consequently, the design process becomes complex,
time-consuming, and requires specialized knowledge. It is through
overcoming these challenges that one can unlock the full potential of
TNNs for efficient and scalable processing of sensory signals.  The
current approaches to TNN development are fragmented workflows, as

Large Language Models (LLMs) have become a cornerstone of artificial
intelligence, driving advancements in natural language processing and
decision-making tasks. However, their extensive power demands, resulting
from high computational overhead and frequent external memory access,
significantly hinder their scalability and deployment, especially in
energy-constrained environments such as edge devices. This escalates the
cost of operation while also limiting accessibility to these LLMs, which
therefore calls for energy-efficient approaches designed to handle
billion-parameter models. Current approaches to reduce the computational
and memory needs of LLMs are based either on general-purpose processors
or on GPUs, with a combination of weight quantization and

[A Comprehensive RF Characterization and Modeling Methodology for the

</div>

This paper aims to provide insights into the thermal, analog, and RF
attributes, as well as a novel modeling methodology, for the FinFET at
the industry standard 5nm CMOS technology node. Thermal characterization
shows that for a 165K change in temperature, the Sub-threshold Slope
(SS) and threshold voltage vary by 69 % and ~70 mV, respectively. At
room temperature, a single gate contacted n-FinFET RF device exhibits a
cutoff and maximum oscillation frequency of ~100 GHz and ~170 GHz,
respectively. Analog and RF Figures of Merit (FoMs) for 5 nm technology
at a device level and their temperature sensitivity are also reported.
The industry standard BSIM-CMG model is modified to capture the impact
of self-heating (SH) and parasitics. The SH model is based on measured
data, and the modeling approach renders it independent of other model
parameters. To the authors’ knowledge, an iteration free approach to
develop a model-card for RF applications is explained for the very first
time. Excellent agreement between the measured data and the model
indicates that our methodology is accurate and can be used for faster
PDK development.

In semiconductor design, “sign-off” during the tape-out (tapeout) of a
chip refers to the formal approval process to ensure that the chip
design is error-free, meets all specifications, and is ready for
manufacturing at the foundry. It is essential because it minimizes the
risk of costly errors, ensures compliance with foundry requirements, and

Clock Gating is defined as: “Clock gating is a technique/methodology to
turn off the clock to certain parts of the digital design when not
needed”.   The Need for Clock Gating   With most of the SoCs heavily
constrained by power budgets, it is of utmost importance to reduce power
consumption as much as possible

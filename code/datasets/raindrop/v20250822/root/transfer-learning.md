\*\*Transfer Learning\*\* is a machine learning technique where a model
trained on one task is re-purposed and fine-tuned for a related, but
different task. The idea behind transfer learning is to leverage the
knowledge learned from a pre-trained model to solve a new, but related
problem. This can be useful in situations where there is limited data
available to train a new model from scratch, or when the new task is
similar enough to the original task that the pre-trained model can be
adapted to the new problem with only minor modifications. ( Image

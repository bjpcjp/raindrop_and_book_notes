    <p class="card-excerpt">In response to yesterday’s post on management design patterns, many readers asked for examples of best practices. So I’m going to write about the management best practices I have been taught and I have observed in startups. This is the first post of that series. The first management technique is called Situational Management, one that my wife, a terrific manager at Google, taught me. A manager’s most important function in a startup is to motivate employees to accomplish the business’s goal.</p>

    <p class="card-excerpt">New research reveals that how we perform work as a team contributes more to resilience than external stressors. On resilient teams, individuals feel responsible for energizing each other. This is in stark contrast to teams who are challenged by frustrating ways of working and fractured relationships. As we move into the third year of pandemic uncertainty, adopting three simple practices will help managers build more resilient — and re-energized — teams.</p>

    <p class="card-excerpt">The traditional corporate approach to motivating people has been a combination of carrots and sticks: a system of financial incentives designed to mobilize everyone around a plan designed by a few smart people at the top. Multiple studies have confirmed that, for any work involving cognitive or creative skills, financial rewards do not drive motivation and performance. So, what does? According to former Best Buy CEO Hubert Joly, it takes several mutually reinforcing elements to create an environment that unleashes the kind of human magic necessary for a company purpose to take root and flourish. He presents six ingredients to create your company’s unique recipe for human magic.</p>

    <p class="card-excerpt">Most bosses live in fear that their best employees will leave, so it might seem to be a bad idea to encourage your stars to consider outside offers. But in fact, it sends employees a clear signal that you really care about their learning and development. Openness allows for an honest conversation between you and each employee about their future career path. If they do decide to leave, they’ll be more likely to recommend you as a great boss, and also more likely to return at some future point.</p>

    <p class="card-excerpt">One question that has long plagued organizations is how to create high-performing front lines — without unexpected consequences. The solution may be simple: Focus on motivating frontline workers. An experiment with a national retail organization found that transforming the operating model of some stores, to boost the motivation of their employees, raised productivity, customer satisfaction, and sales. The key was to get rid of motivational tactics that created emotional and economic pressure on employees, and instead build systems to encourage learning and a sense of play and purpose in the work.</p>

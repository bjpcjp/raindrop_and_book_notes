</div>

We may have learned that we need to let people speak without
interrupting but taking turns talking does not truly denote listening.
And unintentionally hijacking conversations to advise, inject humor,
empathize, prioritize efficiency, or insert ourselves into the speaker’s
narrative is often done with good intentions, but may instead disrupt
the human connection we think we’re forging. Recognizing when to shift
out of our habitual styles and consciously apply alternative styles of
listening and responding may allow for more effective and meaningful
interactions.

Senior leaders, particularly CEOs, confront a central paradox in their
work: They generally have access to more lines of communication than
anybody else, but the information that flows to them is suspect and
compromised. Warning signals are tamped down. Key facts are omitted.
Data sets are given a positive spin. All of it isolates leaders in a
dangerous information bubble. But they can escape that bubble, the
authors argue, by working actively to create a more expansive “listening
ecosystem.” They first have to learn how to listen actively themselves,
without distraction or judgment, purely for comprehension; then they
have to create systems and processes all around them that elevate
listening to a constant state of hypervigilance. This sort of sustained
attention to listening allows leaders to pick up on early signs of both
danger and opportunity—and that, in turn, allows them to do their jobs
and serve their organizations better. The authors conclude this piece by
sharing advice—gleaned from interviews and personal experience—about how
leaders can learn to listen better.

[Startup Best Practices 1 - Situational Management by
@ttunguz](http://tomtunguz.com/management-best-practice-1)

In response to yesterday’s post on management design patterns, many
readers asked for examples of best practices. So I’m going to write
about the management best practices I have been taught and I have
observed in startups. This is the first post of that series. The first
management technique is called Situational Management, one that my wife,
a terrific manager at Google, taught me. A manager’s most important
function in a startup is to motivate employees to accomplish the
business’s goal.

New research reveals that how we perform work as a team contributes more
to resilience than external stressors. On resilient teams, individuals
feel responsible for energizing each other. This is in stark contrast to
teams who are challenged by frustrating ways of working and fractured
relationships. As we move into the third year of pandemic uncertainty,
adopting three simple practices will help managers build more resilient
— and re-energized — teams.

The traditional corporate approach to motivating people has been a
combination of carrots and sticks: a system of financial incentives
designed to mobilize everyone around a plan designed by a few smart
people at the top. Multiple studies have confirmed that, for any work
involving cognitive or creative skills, financial rewards do not drive
motivation and performance. So, what does? According to former Best Buy
CEO Hubert Joly, it takes several mutually reinforcing elements to
create an environment that unleashes the kind of human magic necessary
for a company purpose to take root and flourish. He presents six
ingredients to create your company’s unique recipe for human magic.

</div>

Most bosses live in fear that their best employees will leave, so it
might seem to be a bad idea to encourage your stars to consider outside
offers. But in fact, it sends employees a clear signal that you really
care about their learning and development. Openness allows for an honest
conversation between you and each employee about their future career
path. If they do decide to leave, they’ll be more likely to recommend
you as a great boss, and also more likely to return at some future
point.

</div>

One question that has long plagued organizations is how to create
high-performing front lines — without unexpected consequences. The
solution may be simple: Focus on motivating frontline workers. An
experiment with a national retail organization found that transforming
the operating model of some stores, to boost the motivation of their
employees, raised productivity, customer satisfaction, and sales. The
key was to get rid of motivational tactics that created emotional and
economic pressure on employees, and instead build systems to encourage
learning and a sense of play and purpose in the work.

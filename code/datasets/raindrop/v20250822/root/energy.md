[Thoughts on Electricity Storage \| Turkeys in the
Desert](https://jgkramer.github.io/2023/02/28/Storage.html?ref=the-diff)

</div>

Energy storage – both home-scale and utility-scale – has become more
relevant as the use of renewable energy for electricity generation
proliferates. It is particularly topical recently, as the Inflation
Reduction Act includes tax credits specifically targeting energy storage
projects. Energy storage (chemical batteries, pumped hydro storage,
gravity-based batteries) transports electrical energy through time, from
generation earlier to consumption later. Storage works when the
aggregate amount of energy generated is adequate to satisfy aggregate
demand, but there is a mismatch in the timing of supply and demand. Some
basic fact patterns are: Demand More Variable than Supply. As discussed
in previous posts, there is both a daily and a seasonal cycle to
electricity usage. If a region’s generation is dominated by traditional
base-load type power plants with high and constant generation capacity
(nuclear, coal) or are quickly dispatchable (natural gas), there are two
basic choices for meeting demand: either have enough generation capacity
to cover the peak usage at any time, or marry sub-peak generation with
the ability to store energy when demand is below supply and then release
it for use when demand exceeds capacity. Supply More Variable through
time than Demand. Supply can also be more variable than demand. Solar,
for instance, generates electricity only during an 8-14 hour period
during the daytime. The daily cycle of electricity usage varies but not
this much: there is meaningful demand in the evening and through the
night. So a grid with significant solar power will likely need to store
daytime-generated energy to be deployed at night. Unplanned
Intermittancy. A special case of supply variability: power outages due
to storms or maintenance, or unfavorable weather conditions for solar /
wind, can cause generation to temporarily fall short of demand. This
post will illustrate, using real-world electricity demand data and
overly simplistic supply models (with no unplanned outages or weather
intermittency) what profile of storage could be useful: how much energy
capacity is needed and how frequently it is used. In all cases there
will be a real-world question of whether it is more efficient to deploy
capital in storage solutions or more generation capacity to compensate.
A complete answer to that question is beyond the scope of this post, but
my analysis provides some indication of feasibility of different
architectures. Here’s a summary: In the constant generation model of
traditional generation plants, it appears feasible to use battery
storage to substitute for power generation that would cover the last
~10 - 20% of peak demand. Somewhat frustratingly, the strong variability
of demand still means that this implies generation capacity that is
adequate to supply more than 1.5 times the aggregate energy needs. In a
variable generation model like predominantly solar,1 there is some
benefit in warm climates with mild winters from aligning higher summer
generation with higher summer demand. But substantial storage is needed
(probably more than is economical) to manage the day-night cycle. As
with fixed generation however, there is so much variability of demand
over time that the generation capacity measured in GWh needs to be a
reasonable multiple of aggregate energy consumed. A combination, heavily
weighted towards fixed, can get benefits of both fixed generation (no
daily cycle) and solar (more generation with higher summer demand). This
post ignores wind power, which is too unpredictable for me to handle at
this time. ↩

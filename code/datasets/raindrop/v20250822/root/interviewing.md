[38 Smart Questions to Ask in a Job
Interview](https://hbr.org/2022/05/38-smart-questions-to-ask-in-a-job-interview)

</div>

The opportunity to ask questions at the end of a job interview is one
you don’t want to waste. It’s both a chance to continue to prove
yourself and to find out whether a position is the right fit for you. In
this piece, the author lists sample questions recommended by two career
experts and divides them up by category: from how to learn more about
your potential boss to how to learn more about a company’s culture.
Choose the ones that are more relevant to you, your interests, and the
specific job ahead of time. Then write them down — either on a piece of
paper or on your phone — and glance at them right before your interview
so that they’re fresh in your mind. And, of course, be mindful of the
interviewer’s time. If you were scheduled to talk for an hour and they
turn to you with five minutes left, choose two or three questions that
are most important to you. You will always have more time to ask
questions once you have the job offer in hand.

[5 Questions Every Manager Needs to Ask Their Direct
Reports](https://hbr.org/2022/01/5-questions-every-manager-needs-to-ask-their-direct-reports)

[![](https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2022/01/Jan22_22_1076982960.jpg)](https://hbr.org/2022/01/5-questions-every-manager-needs-to-ask-their-direct-reports)

</div>

If you’re worried that your employees are eyeing the door, it’s time to
start having some important career-defining conversations. In this
piece, executive coach Susan Peppercorn outlines five questions to start
asking your direct reports so that you can get a better sense of how
they’re feeling about their positions: 1) How would you like to grow
within this organization? 2) Do you feel a sense of purpose in your job?
3) What do you need from me to do your best work? 4) What are we
currently not doing as a company that you feel we should do? 5) Do you
have the opportunity to do what you do best every day? When managers
make checking in with these five questions a regular part of how they
interact with their employees, it helps ensure that people feel seen and
valued. And when managers help individuals on their teams feel that way,
they’re more likely to be rewarded by employees who become advocates for
the department and organization, no matter how long they stay.

Many people realize that inverting a binary tree on a whiteboard has
basically zero correlation to whether or not someone is actually a good
software developer. The most effective programming test anyone’s come up
with is still Fizzbuzz. One consequence of this has been an increased
emphasis on Open Source Contributions, but it turns out these aren’t a
very good metric either, because most people don’t have that kind of
time.

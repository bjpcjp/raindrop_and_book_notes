learn generative models mapping from simple latent distributions to
arbitrarily complex data distributions has been...

I bet most of us have seen a lot of AI-generated people faces in recent
times, be it in papers or blogs. We have reached a stage where it is
becoming increasingly difficult to distinguish between actual human
faces and faces that are generated by Artificial Intelligence. In this
post, I will help the reader to understand how they can create and build
such applications on their own. I will try to keep this post as
intuitive as possible for starters while not dumbing it down too much.
This post is about understanding how GANs work.

Emil Mikhailov is the founder of XIX.ai \[http://XIX.ai\] (YC W17).
Roman Trusov is a researcher at XIX.ai. Recent studies by Google Brain
have shown that any machine learning classifier can be tricked to give
incorrect predictions, and with a little bit of skill, you can get them
to give pretty much any result you want. This fact steadily becomes
worrisome as more and more systems are powered by artificial
intelligence — and many of them are crucial for our safe and comfortable
life. Banks, sur

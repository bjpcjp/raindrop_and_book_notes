So I stumbled a few weeks ago on this video
\[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4y7tf3VJAM\] about the world's
smallest conlang and I've been thinking about it ever since.
\[https://staging.cohostcdn.org/attachment/91c54129-9425-4695-bd68-6f65d83ae793/maxresdefault.jpeg\]
\[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4y7tf3VJAM\] (You will probably have
the idea more than fully by the ten minute mark.) This fascinated me. I
think languages are really interesting but I'm also really bad at them.
I cannot hack the memorization. I've mostly avoided conlangs (that's
Constructed Languages, like Esperanto or Klingon) because like, oh no,
now there's even more languages for me to fail at memorizing. So like, a
language so minimal you can almost learn it by accident, suddenly my
ears perk up. Toki pona is really interesting, on a lot of different
axes. It's a thought experiment in Taoist philosophy that turns out to
be actually, practically useful. It's Esperanto But It Might Actually
Work This Time¬π. It has NLP implications‚Äî it's a human language which
feels natural to speak yet has such a deeply logical structure it seems
nearly custom-designed for simple computer programs to read and write
it¬≤. Beyond all this it's simply beautiful as an intellectual
object‚Äî¬†nearly every decision it makes feels deeply right. It solves a
seemingly insoluble problem¬≥ and does it with a sense of effortlessness
and an implied "LOL"
\[https://staging.cohostcdn.org/attachment/747b4517-a3cf-438b-a6a0-07ad9e6883fd/Toki_pona.svg.png\]
at every step. So what toki pona is. Toki pona is a language designed
around the idea of being as simple as it is possible for a language to
be. It has 120 words in its original form (now, at the twenty year mark,
up to 123), but you can form a lot of interesting sentences with only
around twenty or thirty (I know this because this is roughly the size of
my current tok vocabulary). The whole tok-\>en dictionary fits on
seventeen printed pages
\[https://devurandom.xyz/tokipona/dictionary.html\]‚Å¥. There are no
conjugations or tenses to memorize. There are no parts of speech,
generally: almost every single word can be used as almost any part of
speech, drop a pronoun or a preposition‚Åµ in the right place and it
becomes a verb, drop a verb in the right place and it becomes an
adjective. There are almost no ambiguities in sentence structure; I've
only found one significant one so far (using "of" \[pi\] twice in the
same clause) and the community deals with this by just agreeing not to
do that. There's in one sense quite a lot of ambiguity in the vocabulary
but in another sense there's none; for example nena is listed in the
dictionary as meaning hill, mountain, button, bump, nose, but the
official ideology of Toki Pona is that this is not a word with five
definitions, it is a word with exactly one definition, that being the
concept encompassing all five of hills, mountains, buttons, bumps, and
noses. Toki pona words are not ambiguous, they're just broad. I will now
teach you enough toki pona to understand most sentences (assuming you
consult the dictionary
\[https://devurandom.xyz/tokipona/dictionary.html\] as you go) in a
paragraph shorter than this one: Every sentence has an "verb" or action
clause. Most sentences also have a subject clause, which goes before the
verb separated by "li". Some sentences also have an "object" or target
clause, which goes after the verb clause separated by "e". So
"\[subject\] li \[verb\] e \[object\]". All three clauses are any number
of words, the first word is the noun (or verb) and the rest are
adjectives (or adverbs). If the first word in a sentence is mi or sina
you can omit the li in that case only. There is no "is", a sentence like
"a flower is red" is just "\[a plant\] li \[red\]" because there are no
parts of speech and adjectives are verbs. Pronounce everything the way
you would in English except "j" sounds like "y". If you see "tawa",
"lon", "tan" or "kepeken" in adjective/adverb position that's a
preposition, so treat whatever comes after it as a fourth clause. "a"
and "n" are interjections and can go anywhere in a sentence. If you see
"o", "pi", "la", "taso, "anu" or "en", then you've found one of the few
special words (particles) and you should probably either read the book
\[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B012M1RLXS/\] or watch the jan Misali
instructional videos
\[https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLIjft6ja7DM70MkOMu56c4Grku7LXR61\]
on YouTube. That's like‚Ä¶ almost it!‚Å∂ Watch one youtube video, or read a
half page of grammar summary and keep the dictionary open on your phone,
and you're basically ready to jump into conversations. (You'll need
those last six particles to make nuanced sentences, but sentences do not
have to be nuanced.) In my own case I watched the Langfocus video linked
at the top and then lazily over the next week watched the jan Misali
overview \[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLn6LC1RpAo\] and two of
their instructional videos then read a few chapters of the book, and was
already able to construct a full paragraph and be understood by another
person: \> o! mi sona e toki pona. mi lukin sona e toki mute... taso mi
toki ike e toki ale. toki mute li jo e nimi mute. nimi mute li pona ala
tawa mi. toki pona li pona e mi tan ni. toki pona li jo nimi lili. nimi
lili li pona e me :) (Translation: Hello! I am learning toki pona. I've
tried to learn many languages‚Ä¶ but I speak all of the\[m\] badly. Most
languages have a lot of words. Lots of words is not good for me. Toki
pona is good for me because of this. Toki pona has few words. Few words
is good for me :)‚Å∑) So that's week one. By the end of week three
(that'll be this past Sunday) I had hit three milestones: \* I was able
to make a joke in toki pona. Not a good one. \* When the joke misfired,
I was able to successfully toss off an entire complex paragraph rapidly
without really thinking about it. \* Probably a sign I Am Getting It
more significant than anything else: I realized that talking on the
Discord I was dropping toki pona words into my English sentences solely
because the toki pona word seemed to me to communicate a concept I
wanted to communicate more precisely than any particular English word.
(That last one actually kind of excited me when I realized, after the
fact, that it had been happening for several days before I noticed it.)
All of the above happened on the toki pona Discord, which seems to be
the largest and healthiest outpost of toki pona community online‚Å∏ and, I
assume therefore, the world. Here's my toki pona joke; you'll notice
that I begin by preemptively apologizing for it, but by the end it
becomes clear I was, at that moment anyway, apparently completely on the
Discord's level:‚Åπ

---------------------------------------- Footnotes ¬π Esperanto was meant
to be an auxillary language simple enough the entire world could learn
it as a second language. But it does not seem to me to be actually all
that simple to learn (the verb tenses may be free of exceptions, but
there are still like six of them) and it seems hard to convince myself
to study it when I could put that effort toward a more widespread
language. Toki Pona on the other hand is a language simple enough the
entire world actually could learn it, had it reason to, and the buy-in
cost in time is a lot lower. Meanwhile Toki Pona just seems to get
certain international-accessibility things right, probably due to the
advantage of having over a century of conlang practice largely inspired
by Esperanto to draw from. The difference that's most interesting to me,
but which I'm also least qualified to evaluate, is that the Toki Pona
author had some basic familiarity with, and gave Toki Pona input from,
east Asian languages. Both Toki Pona and Esperanto draw roots from a
variety of languages but in Esperanto's case this winds up being mostly
European languages, mostly Italian, whereas Toki Pona has Mandarin and
Cantonese in its mix. Both languages were intended to have a minimal,
universal phonology but Esperanto's is not very universal at all and has
some consonant sounds that are going to be be totally unfamiliar unless
you speak Polish or a language related to Polish. Toki Pona's phonology
is actually minimal-- it has the letters in the sentence "mi jan pi ko
suwi lete" and nothing else and the legal syllabary is basically
hiragana without the combination syllables. Now, what I don't know is
whether any of this actually helps speakers of Asian languages in
practice or if it just makes surface choices that make it seem that way
to a westerner like me. In practice if you find a toki pona speaker
their native language is almost certainly English, so there doesn't seem
to have been a great deal of testing as to how learnable it is to people
from varied regions. ¬≤ I kept imagining toki pona as being like LLVM IR
for human languages or something. ¬≥ Designing an actually learnable,
universal(?) international auxillary language. ‚Å¥ By which I mean if you
print the unofficial web version it's 17 pages long. But you can fit it
in sixteen if you remove the web-specific introductory paragraph, the
"joke word" kijetesantakalu, and the web footer with the "trans rights
now!" banner in it. ‚Åµ There's an awkward nuance in the specific case of
prepositions: if you drop a preposition into verb position it still
winds up "behaving like" a preposition, it's just that the preposition
describes an action. It's probably more accurate to say that the
preposition phrase becomes a verb rather than the preposition itself. So
for example "mi tawa kalama" means "I went toward the sound" \[kamala is
a noun and the object of the preposition\] not "I went loudly" \[as it
would be if kamala were an adverb modifying tawa as a verb\]. Going into
detail on this because I don't want to mislead anyone but "you can form
a sentence using an unmodified preposition as a verb" is such a fun fact
I...

A decade before Airbnb persuaded homeowners to transform their homes
into hotels, Netflix convinced its users to turn theirs into mini
Netflix warehouses. Customers who held onto their DVDs for longer meant
fewer shipping costs for Netflix, and fewer DVDs for the company to

them internally as “pigs” — and secretly throttled their deliveries. It
didn’t matter if Netflix rented fewer DVDs than Blockbuster, because the
company would keep collecting its monthly fee. The difference between
Blockbuster and Netflix was this: Blockbuster punished customers for
being forgetful; Netflix rewarded them for being mindless.

Network effects are one of the most important dynamics in software and

either you have them, or you don’t. In practice, most companies’ network

The most significant bottleneck in the adoption of healthcare technology

they failed to find an executable path for sustainable distribution and

[The 3 Competitive Defenses of Enduring SaaS Companies by
@ttunguz](http://tomtunguz.com/saas-barriers-to-entry)

A technology advantage isn’t enough to build an enduring enterprise SaaS
company because at the core, all SaaS software share the same
architecture. A relational database stores data and a web site presents
the data. This is true for CRM (Salesforce), marketing automation
(Marketo), email (Exchange), content management systems (Sharepoint) and
so on. Because SaaS apps use standard databases, engineers can easily
transfer the data from one database to another. I’m greatly simplifying
here because differences in architecture may exist, but in principle
it’s simple to extract, transform and load data from one relational
database into another.

Since Benchmark’s investment in Ebay 15 years ago, we have been
fascinated by online marketplaces. Entrepreneurs accurately recognize
that the connective tissue of the Internet provides an opportunity to
link the players in a particular market, reducing friction in both the
buying and selling experience. For example, my car tax check is an
online platfrom that allows you to book a slot for a complete history
and guidance of your car taxes and other details. The arrival of the
smartphone amplifies these opportunities, as the Internet’s connective

In many ways, online marketplaces are the perfect business model. Since
they facilitate transactions between independent suppliers and customers
rather than take possession of and responsibility for the products or
services in question, they have inherently low cost structures and fat
gross margins. They are highly defensible once established, owing to
network effects. Yet online marketplaces remain extremely difficult to
build, say Andrei Hagiu of Harvard Business School and venture
capitalist Simon Rothman of Greylock Partners. Most entrepreneurs and
investors attribute this to the challenge of quickly attracting a
critical mass of buyers and suppliers. But it is wrong to assume that
once a marketplace has overcome this hurdle, the sailing will be smooth.
Several other important pitfalls can threaten marketplaces: growing too
fast too early; failing to foster sufficient trust and safety; resorting
to sticks, rather than carrots, to deter user disintermediation; and
ignoring the risks of regulation. This article draws on company examples
such as eBay, Lending Club, and Airbnb to offer practical advice for
avoiding those hazards.

</div>

Five of the 10 most valuable companies in the world today—Apple,
Alphabet, Amazon, Facebook, and Microsoft—derive much of their worth
from their multisided platforms, which facilitate interactions or
transactions between parties. Many MSPs are more valuable than companies
in the same industries that provide only products or services: For
instance, Airbnb is now worth more than Marriott, the world’s largest
hotel chain. However, companies that weren’t born as platform businesses
rarely realize that they can—at least partially—turn their offerings
into one, say the authors. And even if they do realize it, they often
wander in the dark searching for a strategy to achieve this
transformation. In this article, Hagiu and Altman provide a framework
for doing so. They lay out four specific ways in which products and
services can be turned into platforms and examine the strategic
advantages and pitfalls of each: (1) opening the door to third parties;
(2) connecting customers; (3) connecting products to connect customers;
and (4) becoming a supplier to a multisided platform. These ideas can be
used by physical as well as online businesses.

Editor's Note: The following is a guest post by Simon Rothman of
Greylock Partners. Rothman is particularly passionate about Marketplace
technology (Etsy, Kickstarter, Airbnb, etc) and how to garner success in
that category. Marketplaces are endemic to the consumer web: Largely
popularized by eBay, we've recently seen quite a few variations on the
theme, like young guns Etsy, oDesk, Airbnb, and Kickstarter. Old or new,
the two elements that bind all marketplaces are network effects (a good
thing) and the chicken-and-egg problem (not such a good thing).

Credit where it's definitely due: this post was inspired by a Twitter
conversation with Box CEO Aaron Levie. Don't look now, but something
remarkable is happening. Instagram had twelve employees when it was
purchased for \$700 million; all of its actual computing power was
outsourced to Amazon Web Services. Mighty ARM has only 2300 employees,
but there are more than 35 billion ARM-based chips out there. They do no
manufacturing; instead they license their designs to companies like
Apple, who in turn contract with companies like TSMC for the actual
fabrication. Nest Labs and Ubiquiti are both 200-employee hardware
companies worth circa \$1 billion...who subcontract their actual
manufacturing out to China.

</div>

In early and developing markets, selling complete products is often a
superior go to market strategy, rather than selling an innovation in a
layer in the stack. This is true for five reasons. First, for early
customers to generate value from a novel technology, that technology
must solve a business problem completely. End-to-end products do that.
Layers in the stack don’t. They optimize existing systems. In early
markets, customers want to buy a car, not a better camshaft.

Suppose you’ve started a company that’s creating a category. Most buyers
in your target market haven’t heard of your business or the kind of
software you sell. There’s no budget line item, no Magic Quadrant, no G2
High Performer Award, no conference. You have an idea, a vast blue ocean
in front of you, and a pile of greenbacks stashed in a bank account from
your last financing. Do you spend aggressively to create the category or
conserve capital, knowing education will take time?

20 years ago Apple seized music, and turned it into a lever for its

music, but won massively in games, where it now makes more money than
the entire global digital music industry. Now, perhaps, it’s looking at

</div>

How does Netflix get away with releasing its movies in theaters on the
same day it makes them available for “free” on its streaming platform?
The answer is that Netflix is pursuing a fundamentally different
business model from everyone else in the industry. Netflix is not in the
business of selling individual movies to many different customers.
Instead, it’s in the business of selling many different movies to
individual customers—in bundles. Bundled subscriptions allow Netflix to
practice a different kind of price discrimination from the movie
studios. The company doesn’t have to figure out how much a consumer
values any individual movie on the service. The bundle does that for
them—very profitably.

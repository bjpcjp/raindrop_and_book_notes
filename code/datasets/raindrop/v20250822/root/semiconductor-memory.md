Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) have become a de facto solution for
accelerating high-performance computing (HPC) applications.
Understanding their memory error behavior is an essential step toward
achieving efficient and reliable HPC systems. In this work, we present a
large-scale cross-supercomputer study to characterize GPU memory
reliability, covering three supercomputers - Delta, Polaris, and
Perlmutter - all equipped with NVIDIA A100 GPUs. We examine error logs
spanning 67.77 million GPU device-hours across 10,693 GPUs. We compare
error rates and mean-time-between-errors (MTBE) and highlight both
shared and distinct error characteristics among these three systems.
Based on these observations and analyses, we discuss the implications
and lessons learned, focusing on the reliable operation of
supercomputers, the choice of checkpointing interval, and the comparison
of reliability characteristics with those of previous-generation GPUs.
Our characterization study provides valuable insights into
fault-tolerant HPC system design and operation, enabling more efficient
execution of HPC applications.

Traditional von Neumann architectures suffer from fundamental
bottlenecks due to continuous data movement between memory and
processing units, a challenge that worsens with technology scaling as
electrical interconnect delays become more significant. These
limitations impede the performance and energy efficiency required for
modern data-intensive applications. In contrast, photonic in-memory
computing presents a promising alternative by harnessing the advantages
of light, enabling ultra-fast data propagation without length-dependent
impedance, thereby significantly reducing computational latency and
energy consumption. This work proposes a novel differential photonic
static random access memory (pSRAM) bitcell that facilitates
electro-optic data storage while enabling ultra-fast in-memory Boolean
XOR computation. By employing cross-coupled microring resonators and
differential photodiodes, the XOR-augmented pSRAM (X-pSRAM) bitcell
achieves at least 10 GHz read, write, and compute operations entirely in
the optical domain. Additionally, wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM)
enables n-bit XOR computation in a single-shot operation, supporting
massively parallel processing and enhanced computational efficiency.
Validated on GlobalFoundries' 45SPCLO node, the X-pSRAM consumed 13.2 fJ
energy per bit for XOR computation, representing a significant
advancement toward next-generation optical computing with applications
in cryptography, hyperdimensional computing, and neural networks.

A slide deck revealing the plans (and expectations) for next-generation
High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) technology was published by Korea Advanced
Institute of Science and Technology and TERA (Terabyte Interconnection
and Package Laboratory). Starting with HBM4. This will be the go-to
standard for next-gen data centers and AI GPUs that are launching in
2026. Both AMD and NVIDIA have confirmed the use of HBM for their MI400
and Rubin offerings. Next-gen memory will continue to scale in stacked
layers, but each layer will become thinner. HBM thickness is expected
not to exceed 720 micrometers, with HBM5 targeting 36µm per DRAM die.
Given the increase in power consumption, KAIST and TERA expect that HBM5
(100W) and HBM6 (120W) will already require immersion cooling, while
HBM7 (160W) and HBM8 (180W) could feature embedded cooling solutions.
With the arrival of glass-based silicon interposers, the research firm
highlights the use of embedded cooling as the standard approach, which
will go through the interposer and offer direct-cooling to the HBM, HBF,
and GPU IPs. Read more by Wccftech: https://lnkd.in/d--5qUwx \#HBM

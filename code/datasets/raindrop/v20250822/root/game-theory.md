</div>

Prediction markets are speculative markets created for the purpose of
making predictions. Assets are created whose final cash value is tied to
a particular event or parameter. The current market prices can then be
interpreted as predictions of the probability of the event or the
expected value of the parameter. Prediction markets are thus structured
as betting exchanges, without any risk for the bookmaker. Robin Hanson
was the first to run a corporate prediction market - at Project Xanadu
-, and has made several contributions to the field such as: conditional
predictions, accuracy issues and market and media manipulation. People
who buy low and sell high are rewarded for improving the market
prediction, while those who buy high and sell low are punished for
degrading the market prediction. Evidence so far suggests that
prediction markets are at least as accurate as other institutions
predicting the same events with a similar pool of participants.
Predictions markets have been used by organizations such as Google,
General Electric, and Microsoft; several online and commercial
prediction markets are also in operation. Historically, prediction
markets have often been used to predict election outcomes. See Also \*

</div>

Quadratic voting is a rated voting method procedure where voters express
the degree of their preferences. By doing so, quadratic voting seeks to
address issues of the Condorcet paradox and tyranny of the majority.
Quadratic voting works by allowing users to "pay" for additional votes
on a given outcome to express their support for given issues more
strongly, resulting in voting outcomes that are aligned with the highest
willingness to pay outcome, rather than just the outcome preferred by
the majority regardless of the intensity of individual preferences. The
payment for votes may be through either artificial or real currencies.
Quadratic voting is a variant of cumulative voting, which differs in
that the weight of a vote is normalized using the sum of squares, rather
than the sum of absolute values.

[Black–Scholes model -
Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black%E2%80%93Scholes_model)

</div>

The Black–Scholes /ˌblæk ˈʃoʊlz/\[1\] or Black–Scholes–Merton model is a
mathematical model for the dynamics of a financial market containing
derivative investment instruments. From the parabolic partial
differential equation in the model, known as the Black–Scholes equation,
one can deduce the Black–Scholes formula, which gives a theoretical
estimate of the price of European-style options and shows that the
option has a unique price given the risk of the security and its
expected return (instead replacing the security's expected return with
the risk-neutral rate). The equation and model are named after
economists Fischer Black and Myron Scholes. Robert C. Merton, who first
wrote an academic paper on the subject, is sometimes also credited.

</div>

A Vickrey–Clarke–Groves (VCG) auction is a type of sealed-bid auction of
multiple items. Bidders submit bids that report their valuations for the
items, without knowing the bids of the other bidders. The auction system
assigns the items in a socially optimal manner: it charges each
individual the harm they cause to other bidders. It gives bidders an
incentive to bid their true valuations, by ensuring that the optimal
strategy for each bidder is to bid their true valuations of the items;
it can be undermined by bidder collusion and in particular in some
circumstances by a single bidder making multiple bids under different
names. It is a generalization of a Vickrey auction for multiple items.

How does risky behavior spread? There are two theories: one involving
social cues and the other involving trial-and-error. Covid-19 offered a
chance to study this phenomenon and found evidence for both. In
particular, the authors’ research documents a phenomenon of “risk
creep,” where lucky near-misses (not getting Covid) encourage people to
take riskier behavior in the future.

Though the industry is called venture capital, the goal of a VC isn’t to
maximize every risk. Instead, we try to understand all the risks a
business might face and weigh those risks with the reward - the exit.

Developed during World War II, CARVER is a tool for assessing and
ranking threats and opportunities. It can be both offensive and
defensive, meaning it can be used for identifying your competitors’
weaknesses and for internal auditing. CARVER can help risk management
professional think through an asset’s criticality, accessibility,
recoverability, vulnerability, effect, and recognizability. Since it
draws on both qualitative and quantitative data, CARVER can be applied
in almost any scenario that is analyzed and discussed in an organized,
logical way. It can be highly useful if you need to, for example, defend
a budget request or a strategic plan to company leadership. Because it
helps you articulate an efficient story using numeric values, CARVER can
be used to clarify mission objectives — whether on the battlefield or in
the boardroom.

</div>

When you have to communicate a difficult organizational decision to
employees, it’s hard to know how much information to provide when you
can’t be fully transparent yet. Saying nothing can undermine people’s
trust in your motives and compassion, whereas saying too much can leave
people feeling overwhelmed and vulnerable as they struggle to process
the information and implications. Striking the right balance between
these two extremes is a tricky exercise for leaders. The author presents
five strategies to help you figure out what to say and do when you can’t
yet be fully transparent with your employees.

Even the most effective leaders recognize how much is outside of their
control, but one thing we all have agency over is how we communicate
with others. Clearly articulated requests, the kinds that elicit real
responses, don’t come naturally to most of us. As it turns out, there’s
an art to the request — whether it’s directed at an employee who’s
producing subpar deliverables or a colleague from a different department
who hasn’t been pulling their weight on a collaborative project. Here’s
why requests are so hard to make, what so many leaders are still getting
wrong, and a handful of strategies for issuing requests that elicit
concrete, actionable responses.

When you join a new organization, it’s important to understand who holds
the power because they directly impact how work gets done, but it’s not
always perfectly clear. In this piece, the author offers strategies to
better identify where the true power exists.  “At first glance across
your company, it’s natural to assume that those who have ‘chief’ or
‘senior’ in their titles are the ones that dominate the power
landscape,” the author writes. “But this isn’t always the case.”

[4 Ways to Communicate with More

</div>

The pandemic and other stressful events over the past few years have
only made empathic communications even more desirable and necessary,
especially as those expressions have become more virtual — including
videos, social media posts, and emails. But just as each of us has
varying levels of empathy, not every leader is equally empathic. So is a
lack of natural empathy a showstopper when it comes to expressing and
benefitting from empathic communications? No. The good news is that all
leaders (even those who are not naturally empathic) can communicate
messages of empathy as powerfully as they convey messages of unity and
accountability. During challenging times, the most effective leadership
communications are ones that deliver attention, acknowledge distress,
demonstrate care, and — not necessarily at first, but eventually — take
appropriate action to mitigate the situation or at least provide
comfort. This article offers four touchpoints to focus on in your
communications.

“I’ve probably revised this investor pitch deck 200 times,” a founder
told me recently. She’d met with more than 50 potential investors before
closing a seed round last month. This might sound excessive to some, but
her experience is not unusual. Entrepreneurs often spend hundreds of
hours raising funds from angel and venture capital investors. While
these activities are clearly important, analysis of new data on startups
suggests that founders should also dedicate significant time to
something that many people overlook: recruiting great mentors. This
simple strategy can increase a company’s odds of success more than
almost anything else.

We all know that leaders need vision and energy, but after an exhaustive
review of the most influential theories on leadership–as well as
workshops with thousands of leaders and aspiring leaders–the authors
learned that great leaders also share four unexpected qualities. The
first quality of exceptional leaders is that they selectively reveal
their weaknesses (weaknesses, not fatal flaws). Doing so lets employees
see that they are approachable. It builds an atmosphere of trust and
helps galvanize commitment. The second quality of inspirational leaders
is their heavy reliance on intuition to gauge the appropriate timing and
course of their actions. Such leaders are good “situation sensors”–they
can sense what’s going on without having things spelled out for them.
Managing employees with “tough empathy” is the third quality of
exceptional leadership. Tough empathy means giving people what they
need, not what they want. Leaders must empathize passionately and
realistically with employees, care intensely about the work they do, and
be straightforward with them. The fourth quality of top-notch leaders is
that they capitalize on their differences. They use what’s unique about
themselves to create a social distance and to signal separateness, which
in turn motivates employees to perform better. All four qualities are
necessary for inspirational leadership, but they cannot be used
mechanically; they must be mixed and matched to meet the demands of
particular situations. Most important, however, is that the qualities
encourage authenticity among leaders. To be a true leader, the authors
advise, “Be yourself–more–with skill.”

</div>

How do you make decisions? If you're like most people, you'll probably
answer that you pride yourself on weighing the pros and cons of a
situation carefully and then make a decision based on logic. You know
that other people have weak personalities and are easily swayed by their
emotions, but this rarely happens to you. You've just experienced the
\[fundamental attribution
error\](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_attribution_error) —
the tendency to believe that other people's behaviour is due to their
personality (“Josh is late because he's a disorganised person”) whereas
our behaviour is due to external circumstances (“I'm late because the
directions were useless”). Cognitive biases like these play a
significant role in the way we make decisions so it's not surprising
that people are now examining these biases \*\*to see how to exploit
them in the design of web sites\*\*. I'm going to use the term
‘persuasion architects' to describe designers who knowingly use these
techniques to influence the behaviour of users. (Many skilled designers
already use some of these psychological techniques intuitively — but
they wouldn't be able to articulate why they have made a particular
design choice. The difference between these designers and persuasion
architects is that persuasion architects use these techniques
intentionally).

What does it take to become a more convincing communicator? New research
suggests that linguistic mirroring — that is, adjusting your
communication style to match that of your audience — is an effective
tool to increase your ability to influence others. In this piece, the
authors describe four key dimensions of linguistic mirroring, as well as
several tactical strategies for leaders looking to win over a client,
judge, or other important evaluator. Ultimately, they argue that
building genuine relationships with key evaluators is the best way to
gain insight into their linguistic preferences — but it’s up to all of
us to make sure that we use the power of linguistic mirroring for good.

leading well is an integrated activity, in which one is doing many
things simultaneously. One way to learn to do this better is to think
about leadership as a series of small actions that are practiced, then
carefully sequenced and interwoven during interactions. For instance,
instead of thinking of something as a “difficult conversation,” a leader
might aim to disarm, then show appreciation, then appeal to values.
Research identifies 25 such actions, and learning to implement them in
the right circumstances can help one become a better leader.

</div>

We may have learned that we need to let people speak without
interrupting but taking turns talking does not truly denote listening.
And unintentionally hijacking conversations to advise, inject humor,
empathize, prioritize efficiency, or insert ourselves into the speaker’s
narrative is often done with good intentions, but may instead disrupt
the human connection we think we’re forging. Recognizing when to shift
out of our habitual styles and consciously apply alternative styles of
listening and responding may allow for more effective and meaningful
interactions.

The traditional corporate approach to motivating people has been a
combination of carrots and sticks: a system of financial incentives
designed to mobilize everyone around a plan designed by a few smart
people at the top. Multiple studies have confirmed that, for any work
involving cognitive or creative skills, financial rewards do not drive
motivation and performance. So, what does? According to former Best Buy
CEO Hubert Joly, it takes several mutually reinforcing elements to
create an environment that unleashes the kind of human magic necessary
for a company purpose to take root and flourish. He presents six

The term "bullshitting" (in addition to its colloquial use) is a
technical psychological term that means, "communication characterised by
an intent to be convincing or impressive without concern for truth."
This is not the same as lying, in which one knows what they are saying
is false. Bullshitters simply are indifferent to whether or not

</div>

It’s important to understand that when you, as a leader, communicate
with your team, using weaker words weakens your message and blunts your
ability to inspire people. It’s not enough to just throw thoughts out
there and hope for the best. You need to actively recommend ideas and
assert their worthiness in all of your communications. For example,
consider these “power words”: “I’m proposing (not “sharing”) an idea
that will make our process more efficient.” “I’m suggesting (not
“sharing”) a new logo that better conveys our brand message.” “I’m
recommending (not “sharing”) a campaign to make our workplace more
diverse.” Ultimately, audiences respond more actively to big points than
to small words, but thoughtful leaders need to assess both, knowing that
the more powerfully they come across — even in small ways — the greater
impact they have on the people they hope to inspire.

We live in an age of polarization. Many of us may be asking ourselves
how, when people disagree with or discount us, we can persuade them to
rethink their positions. The author, an organizational psychologist, has
spent time with a number of people who succeeded in motivating the
notoriously self-confident Steve Jobs to change his mind and has
analyzed the science behind their techniques. Some leaders are so sure
of themselves that they reject good opinions and ideas from others and
refuse to abandon their own bad ones. But, he writes, “it is possible to
get even the most overconfident, stubborn, narcissistic, and
disagreeable people to open their minds.” He offers some approaches that
can help you encourage a know-it-all to recognize when there’s something
to be learned, a stubborn colleague to make a U-turn, a narcissist to
show humility, and a disagreeable boss to agree with you.

More than 2,000 years ago Aristotle outlined a formula on how to become
a master of persuasion in his work Rhetoric . To successfully sell your
next idea, try using these five rhetorical devices that he identified in
your next speech or presentation: The first is egos or “character.” In
order for your audience to trust you, start your talk by establishing
your credibility. Then, make a logical appeal to reason, or “logos.” Use
data, evidence, and facts to support your pitch. The third device, and
perhaps the most important, is “pathos,” or emotion. People are moved to
action by how a speaker makes them feel. Aristotle believed the best way
to transfer emotion from one person to another is through storytelling.
The more personal your content is the more your audience will feel
connected to you and your idea.

Some bosses lack the political aptitude or key competencies that would
let them help you get ahead. When you realize that your manager is out
of the loop and your opportunities for influence within the company are
limited, focus on getting you more access to communications. Identify
individuals who can connect you with important information, and then
find a low-key way to meet. As you develop relationships with senior
leaders, review who is successful at selling ideas or meeting goals. Use
this information to fine-tune your interactions and approaches. And,
identify where your talents would most benefit the company so that you
can become a key contributor to the organization. Don’t rely on anyone
else — including a manager with higher standing — to open doors for you.

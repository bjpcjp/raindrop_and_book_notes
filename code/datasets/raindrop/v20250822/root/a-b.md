A/B testing is a cornerstone of data science, essential for making
informed business decisions and optimizing customer revenue. Here, we
delve into six widely used statistical methods in A/B testing,
explaining their purposes and appropriate contexts. 1. Z-Test (Standard
Score Test): When to Use: This method is ideal for large sample sizes
(typically over 30) when the population variance is known. Purpose:
Compares the means of two groups to determine if they are statistically
different. Applications: This technique is frequently employed in
conversion rate optimization and click-through rate analysis. It helps
identify whether changes in website elements or marketing strategies

A/B tests are controlled experiments of two attributes, to measure which
one was most popular with users. You can apply A/B testing to just about
anything that you can measure. Multivariate testing allows you to
measure multiple variables simultaneously.

Which layout of an advertisement leads to more clicks? Would a different
color or position of the purchase button lead to a higher conversion
rate? Does a special offer really attract more customers – and which of
two phrasings would be better? For a long time, people have trusted
their gut feeling to answer these questions. Today all these questions
could be answered by conducting an A/B test. For this purpose, visitors
of a website are randomly assigned to one of two groups between which
the target metric (i.e. click-through rate, conversion rate…) can then
be compared. Due to this randomization, the groups do not systematically
differ in all other relevant dimensions. This means: If your target
metric takes a significantly higher value in one group, you can be quite
sure that it is because of your treatment and not because of any other
variable. In comparison to other methods, conducting an A/B test does
not require extensive statistical knowledge. Nevertheless, some caveats
have to be taken into account. When making a statistical decision, there
are two possible errors (see also table 1): A Type I error means that we
observe a significant result although there is no real difference
between our groups. A Type II error means that we do not observe a
significant result although there is in fact a difference. The Type I
error can be controlled and set to a fixed number in advance, e.g., at
5%, often denoted as α or the significance level. The Type II error in
contrast cannot be controlled directly. It decreases with the sample
size and the magnitude of the actual effect. When, for example, one of
the designs performs way better than the other one, it’s more likely
that the difference is actually detected by the test in comparison to a
situation where there is only a small difference with respect to the
target metric. Therefore, the required sample size can be computed in
advance, given α and the minimum effect size you want to be able to
detect (statistical power analysis). Knowing the average traffic on the
website you can get a rough idea of the time you have to wait for the
test to complete. Setting the rule for the end of the test in advance is
often called “fixed-horizon testing”. Table 1: Overview over possible
errors and correct decisions in statistical tests Effect really exists
No Yes Statistical test is significant No True negative Type II error
(false negative) Yes Type I error (false positive) True positive
Statistical tests generally provide the p-value which reflects the
probability of obtaining the observed result (or an even more extreme
one) just by chance, given that there is no effect. If the p-value is
smaller than α, the result is denoted as “significant”. When running an
A/B test you may not always want to wait until the end but take a look
from time to time to see how the test performs. What if you suddenly
observe that your p-value has already fallen below your significance
level – doesn’t that mean that the winner has already been identified
and you could stop the test? Although this conclusion is very appealing,
it can also be very wrong. The p-value fluctuates strongly during the
experiment and even if the p-value at the end of the fixed-horizon is
substantially larger than α, it can go below α at some point during the
experiment. This is the reason why looking at your p-value several times
is a little bit like cheating, because it makes your actual probability
of a Type I error substantially larger than the α you chose in advance.
This is called “α inflation”. At best you only change the color or
position of a button although it does not have any impact. At worst,
your company provides a special offer which causes costs but actually no
gain. The more often you check your p-value during the data collection,
the more likely you are to draw wrong conclusions. In short: As
attractive as it may seem, don’t stop your A/B test early just because
you are observing a significant result. In fact you can prove that if
you increase your time horizon to infinity, you are guaranteed to get a
significant p-value at some point in time. The following code simulates
some data and plots the course of the p-value during the test. (For the
first samples which are still very small R returns a warning that the
chi square approximation may be incorrect.) library(timeDate)

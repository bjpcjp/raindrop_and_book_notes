they represent something recognizable, like a fire, or a person slipping

</div>

An L-system or Lindenmayer system is a parallel rewriting system and a
type of formal grammar. An L-system consists of an alphabet of symbols
that can be used to make strings, a collection of production rules that
expand each symbol into some larger string of symbols, an initial
"axiom" string from which to begin construction, and a mechanism for
translating the generated strings into geometric structures. L-systems
were introduced and developed in 1968 by Aristid Lindenmayer, a
Hungarian theoretical biologist and botanist at the University of
Utrecht.\[1\] Lindenmayer used L-systems to describe the behaviour of
plant cells and to model the growth processes of plant development.
L-systems have also been used to model the morphology of a variety of
organisms\[2\] and can be used to generate self-similar fractals.

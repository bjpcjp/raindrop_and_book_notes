A decade before Airbnb persuaded homeowners to transform their homes
into hotels, Netflix convinced its users to turn theirs into mini
Netflix warehouses. Customers who held onto their DVDs for longer meant
fewer shipping costs for Netflix, and fewer DVDs for the company to
manage and store. Netflix tracked heavy users of its service — labeling
them internally as “pigs” — and secretly throttled their deliveries. It
didn’t matter if Netflix rented fewer DVDs than Blockbuster, because the
company would keep collecting its monthly fee. The difference between
Blockbuster and Netflix was this: Blockbuster punished customers for
being forgetful; Netflix rewarded them for being mindless.

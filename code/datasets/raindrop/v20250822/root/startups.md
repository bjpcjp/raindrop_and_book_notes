Dyson almost launched a robot vacuum. Back in 2001, after three years in
development. Its first effort, shown to the British public in London
looked nothing (and we mean nothing) like the eventual 360 Eye unveiled
today. Sixteen years is a long time in tech. The DC06, as it was called,
never made it past home-trial stages in 2012 -- apparently too pricey
and heavy. Between then and now, technology got better. A lot better. At
the Tokyo launch of its new robot vacuum, Sir James Dyson himself, told
us how it all came together, and why it's not his native UK, but Japan,
that'll get to buy it first.

</div>

Presented by Robert Beachler, VP of Product, Untether AI. Traditional
processor architectures are failing to keep up with the exploding
compute demands of AI workloads. They are limited by the power-hungry
weight-fetch of von Neumann architectures and limitations of transistor
and frequency scaling. At-memory computation places compute elements
directly in the memory array, providing reduced power consumption and
increased throughput due to the massive parallelism and bandwidth
provided by the architecture. This presentation introduces a new class
of non-von Neumann compute designed to meet these AI demands. The Linley
Fall Processor Conference featured technical presentations addressing
processors and IP cores for AI applications, embedded, data center,
automotive, and communications. Session topic included AI in Edge
Devices, Vector-Processing Cores, Advancing Cloud AI, The New
Infrastructure Edge, Heterogenous Computing, SoC Design, In-Memory
Compute, and Security. Proceedings from the event are available for

for risk — personal characteristics at odds with those traditionally
associated with entrepreneurs.

Here’s a riddle. There was a product in the seventeenth century that was
universally considered a necessity as important as grain and fuel.
Controlling the source of this product was one of the first priorities
for many a military campaign, and sometimes even a motivation for
starting a war. Improvements to the preparation and uses of this product
would have increased population size and would have had a general and
noticeable impact on people’s living standards. And this product
underwent dramatic changes in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries,
becoming an obsession for many inventors and industrialists, while
seemingly not featuring in many estimates of historical economic output
or growth at all.

“caused all our skinns to peele off, from head to foote, as if we had
beene flayed.” During those pitiless months of “starving time” they
turned to eating dogs, cats, rats, mice, venomous snakes, and other
famine foods: mushrooms, toadstools, “or what els we founde growing upon

On the night of April 25, 1986, during a planned maintenance shutdown at
the Chernobyl power plant in northern Ukraine, one of the four reactors
overheated and began to burn. As plant engineers scrambled to regain
control of it, they thought for a moment that there had been an
earthquake. In fact, a buildup of steam had propelled the
two-hundred-ton concrete top of the reactor’s casing into the air, with
masses of radioactive material following close behind when the core
exploded. The plant workers had been assured again and again of the
safety of the “peaceful atom,” and they couldn’t imagine that the
reactor had exploded. Firefighters rushed to the scene without special
equipment or a clear understanding of the potential risks; they had not
been trained to deal with a nuclear explosion, because such training
would have involved acknowledging that an explosion was possible.

The most consequential military engagement in Southeast Asia in the 20th
century is the 1954 Battle of Dien Bien Phu. It was fought ostensibly
between the French and the communist-led Vietmin at Dien Bien Phu, an
obscure valley bordering China, in the remote northwestern part of what
was then French Indochina. The battle ended with a humiliating defeat
for the French, which brought down the French government, ended French
colonial rule in Asia, ushered in America’s epic military involvement in
the region for decades to come, and fundamentally changed the global
geostrategic landscape.

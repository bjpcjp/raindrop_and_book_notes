</div>

At most small and medium-sized e-commerce retailers, prices are
typically set and updated in an ad hoc fashion without one clear owner.
The process often starts by using a gross margin target, followed by
some comparison with competitors, and then some adjustments from there.
Many of these retailers would quickly admit that this isn’t an optimal
strategy, and that they are likely leaving money on the table — and
they’re often right. The authors’ experience with price testing has
shown that there is actually a significant amount of money left on the
table when pricing is left un-optimized.

customer affinity. For multichannel retailers, by understanding the
channel preferences of current customers through transactional data,
multichannel retailers can add an effective catalog marketing channel to
their store and e-commerce channel strategies.

Many websites lose reporting from one of their marketing or analytics
platforms. The culprit is usually the removal of tags during updates to
the sites. Tags are critical for ecommerce merchants. But they add
clutter to websites. That's the purpose of Google Tag Manager — to
manage tags and contain them in a single JavaScript snippet on all
pages.

</div>

Competitive poaching refers to the practice of bidding on ads for a
competitor’s search terms, in order to poach customers searching for
that brand. It’s a common tactic in the world of digital ads — but is it
effective? The author shares results from the first-ever empirical study
of this practice, which found that poaching can work well for higher-end
brands, but may backfire for lower-end or mass market offerings.
Specifically, the study found that when an ad poached customers who
searched for a high-end brand, users clicked on it more, but when an ad
poached a low-end or mass market target, users were less likely to
click. Of course, the author notes that clickthrough rate is just one
metric, and there may be other ways in which a poaching campaign could
be harmful or beneficial. But these findings can help marketers add a
bit of science to the art that is digital advertising, helping them to
optimize campaigns for their unique products and customers.

Keywords are an important building block for ecommerce marketing.
Developing and maintaining a keyword list may help an ecommerce business
understand shoppers and do a better job of marketing to them. In the
context of search engine optimization, searchers' words or phrases
summarize their thoughts, questions, or needs. Those keywords represent
the language people use to ask for help finding resources online.

Today I want to tell a little image processing algorithm story related
to my post last week about the new bwconvhull function in the Image
Processing Toolbox. The developer (Brendan) who worked on this function
came to see me sometime last year to find out how the 'ConvexImage'
measurement offered by regionprops

</div>

The U.S. grocery industry has reached an uncertain crossroads, facing
competition from many sources, but especially German discount stores
ALDI and LIDL, who are aggressively expanding across the United States.
Whether U.S. retailers will maintain their market share hinges on how
they use private-label products (also called white-label goods or store
brands) to fight back. In France, grocers were able to repel ALDI and
LIDL by offering private-label goods that were both affordable and high
quality, but in the UK, retailers chose to offer super-budget
private-label items. They might have been cheap, but they were very
low-quality, and consumers punished them. The U.S. doesn’t have a lot of
experience with private-label goods, so American retailers will have to
come up to speed quickly if they hope to maintain their advantage.

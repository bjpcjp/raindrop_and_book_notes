          <p>Reasoning, the process of devising and executing complex goal-oriented action sequences, remains a critical challenge in AI. Current large language models (LLMs) primarily employ Chain-of-Thought (CoT) techniques, which suffer from brittle task decomposition, extensive data requirements, and high latency. Inspired by the hierarchical and multi-timescale processing in the human brain, we propose the Hierarchical Reasoning Model (HRM), a novel recurrent architecture that attains significant computational depth while maintaining both training stability and efficiency. HRM executes sequential reasoning tasks in a single forward pass without explicit supervision of the intermediate process, through two interdependent recurrent modules: a high-level module responsible for slow, abstract planning, and a low-level module handling rapid, detailed computations. With only 27 million parameters, HRM achieves exceptional performance on complex reasoning tasks using only 1000 training samples. The model operates without pre-training or CoT data, yet achieves nearly perfect performance on challenging tasks including complex Sudoku puzzles and optimal path finding in large mazes. Furthermore, HRM outperforms much larger models with significantly longer context windows on the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC), a key benchmark for measuring artificial general intelligence capabilities. These results underscore HRM's potential as a transformative advancement toward universal computation and general-purpose reasoning systems.</p>

          <p>A lot has happened this month, especially with the releases of new flagship models like GPT-4.5 and Llama 4. But you might have noticed that reactions to these releases were relatively muted. Why? One reason could be that GPT-4.5 and Llama 4 remain conventional models, which means they were trained without explicit reinforcement learning for reasoning. However, OpenAI's recent release of the o3 reasoning model demonstrates there is still considerable room for improvement when investing compute strategically, specifically via reinforcement learning methods tailored for reasoning tasks. While reasoning alone isn't a silver bullet, it reliably improves model accuracy and problem-solving capabilities on challenging tasks (so far). And I expect reasoning-focused post-training to become standard practice in future LLM pipelines. So, in this article, let's explore the latest developments in reasoning via reinforcement learning.</p>

          <p>As you know, I've been writing a lot lately about the latest research on reasoning in LLMs. Before my next research-focused blog post, I wanted to offer something special to my paid subscribers as a thank-you for your ongoing support. So, I've started writing a new book on how reasoning works in LLMs, and here I'm sharing the first Chapter 1 with you. This ~15-page chapter is an introduction reasoning in the context of LLMs and provides an overview of methods like inference-time scaling and reinforcement learning. Thanks for your support! I hope you enjoy the chapter, and stay tuned for my next blog post on reasoning research!</p>

- **Advanced packaging** — Packaging techniques that integrate multiple components into a single package, offering higher bandwidth and lower power than traditional packaging.  
- **Ball grid array (BGA)** — A surface-mount package with an array of solder balls on the bottom for connection to a PCB.  
- **Built-in self-test (BIST)** — Internal test circuitry within a chip that enables self-testing without external stimulus.  
- **Chip-scale package (CSP)** — A package only slightly larger than the die itself, often with signals routed under the die (fan-in).  
- **Die** — An individual piece of semiconductor material on which a circuit is fabricated; can also refer to a packaged unit in some contexts.  
- **Electromigration (EM)** — The movement of metal atoms caused by high current density, which can degrade circuit reliability.  
- **Flip-chip** — A packaging technique where the die is flipped so its active side faces down and connects to the substrate via solder bumps.  
- **Heterogeneous integration** — The co-packaging of different types or technologies of components (e.g., chips, optics, MEMS) in one package.  
- **Interposer** — An intermediate layer that routes electrical connections between dies and substrate or between multiple dies. Can be silicon, glass, or organic.  
- **Microbumps** — Very small solder connections used in 3D stacking or between die and interposers.  
- **Package substrate** — A multi-layer structure that supports and routes signals from the die or interposer to the PCB.  
- **Package-on-package (PoP)** — Stacking of two or more packages vertically to save board space, often with known-good dies.  
- **Redistribution layer (RDL)** — Additional metal layers rerouting die pads to a different pitch or pattern, especially in fan-out packaging.  
- **Silicon bridge** — A small silicon die embedded in a substrate or interposer to route signals between chiplets.  
- **Stand-off** — The vertical gap between dies or between die and substrate, controlled by solder bump height or pillars.  
- **Surface mount technology (SMT)** — Mounting components directly onto the surface of a PCB rather than through holes.  
- **Thermocompression bonding (TCB)** — A die-bonding technique applying heat and pressure locally to form reliable connections without heating the whole board.  
- **Through-silicon via (TSV)** — A vertical via drilled through a silicon die or interposer to connect different layers electrically.  
- **Through-glass via (TGV)** — Vertical electrical connections through glass interposers.  
- **Wire bonding** — Traditional electrical connection using fine wires between die pads and package leads.  
- **Wireless connectivity** — Integration of wireless components in packages, especially relevant for analog/RF integration in heterogeneous systems.

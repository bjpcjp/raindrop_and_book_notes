Advanced packaging for semiconductors integrates multiple components into a single package using technologies such as interposers, silicon bridges, and advanced bonding techniques like hybrid bonding to achieve higher bandwidth and lower power consumption. This approach involves complex materials, substrates, and assembly processes, requiring careful design considerations for thermal management, reliability, and security, all while ongoing standardization efforts and evolving testing methods support this rapidly advancing field.

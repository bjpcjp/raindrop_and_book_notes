- **Abulk (Body effect coefficient)** — Parameter modeling the influence of body bias and channel potential on threshold voltage along the channel.
- **Abundant carriers (Inversion charge, Qi)** — Electrons (or holes) forming the inversion layer enabling conduction in MOSFET channel.
- **Avalanche multiplication factor (M)** — Ratio representing increase of carriers due to impact ionization by hot electrons.
- **Back gate bias (Vbs)** — Voltage applied between substrate and source affecting threshold voltage.
- **Body effect coefficient (γ)** — Parameter quantifying the effect of substrate bias on the MOSFET threshold voltage.
- **Body-to-source forward bias** — Condition where substrate current induces a voltage drop, forward biasing source/body junction.
- **Channel length modulation (CLM)** — Effect where effective channel length reduces with increasing drain voltage, impacting output resistance.
- **Charged impurity scattering** — Scattering of carriers by ionized dopants reducing mobility at low vertical fields.
- **Depletion charge (Qb)** — Charge due to ionized dopants in the substrate depletion region under the channel.
- **Drain-induced barrier lowering (DIBL)** — Reduction in threshold voltage as drain voltage increases due to modulation of potential barrier at the source end.
- **Drain-induced threshold voltage shift (DITS)** — Shift in Vth induced by drain voltage in devices with halo implant.
- **Effective channel length (Leff) and width (Weff)** — Geometrically adjusted values of channel length and width accounting for overlaps and process effects.
- **Effective electric field (Eeff)** — Average vertical field experienced by inversion carriers, combining inversion and depletion charges.
- **Fowler–Nordheim (FN) tunneling** — Quantum tunneling of carriers through a thin gate oxide under high electric fields causing gate leakage.
- **Gate-induced drain leakage (GIDL)** — Leakage current component caused by band-to-band tunneling near drain under negative gate bias.
- **Halo doping (Pocket implant)** — Localized heavy doping near source/drain edges to suppress short-channel effects.
- **Hot carrier effect** — Phenomenon where high-energy carriers generate electron-hole pairs via impact ionization causing substrate current and device degradation.
- **Inversion layer quantization** — Quantum mechanical effect influencing carrier distribution in very thin inversion layers.
- **Intrinsic surface potential (φs)** — Surface band bending potential required to invert the channel.
- **Lateral electric field (Ey)** — Electric field along the channel length due to applied drain voltage.
- **Mobility degradation** — Reduction of carrier mobility due to scattering mechanisms increased by high vertical or lateral electric fields.
- **Narrow width effect (NWE)** — Increase or decrease of Vth as channel width narrows, influenced by isolation technology.
- **Nonuniform channel doping** — Spatial variation of doping concentration in channel vertically and laterally, affecting threshold voltage.
- **Polysilicon depletion** — Formation of depletion region in polysilicon gate reducing effective gate voltage in thin oxide devices.
- **Self-heating** — Temperature increase in the device due to power dissipation, affecting performance.
- **Short channel effect (SCE)** — Reduction of threshold voltage with decrease of channel length caused by charge sharing between gate and source/drain.
- **Saturation velocity (vsat)** — Maximum carrier velocity under high electric field in the MOSFET channel.
- **Substrate current (Isub)** — Current flowing into the substrate due to impact ionization-generated holes in MOSFETs.
- **Surface mobility (μs)** — Mobility of carriers in the inversion layer influenced by surface scattering mechanisms.
- **Threshold voltage (Vth)** — Gate voltage at which strong inversion occurs in the MOSFET channel.
- **Velocity saturation** — Phenomenon where carrier drift velocity reaches a maximum limiting current despite increasing electric field.

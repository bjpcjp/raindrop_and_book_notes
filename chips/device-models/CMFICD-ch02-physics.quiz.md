1. **Q:** Explain how the intrinsic carrier concentration ni in silicon depends on temperature, and derive the expression relating ni(T) to the bandgap energy and temperature.
   **A:** The intrinsic carrier concentration ni depends on temperature through the density of states in the conduction and valence bands and the probability of electron excitation across the bandgap. It increases with temperature as more electrons gain sufficient thermal energy to cross the bandgap Eg. The relation is given by \( n_i(T) = C T^{3/2} \exp(-E_g(T)/2kT) \), where \(C\) is a constant, \(T\) is temperature, \(k\) is Boltzmann's constant, and \(E_g(T)\) is the temperature-dependent bandgap energy. This comes from Equation 2.14, derived by combining the effective densities of states and Maxwell-Boltzmann approximations.
   **External example:** The temperature dependence of intrinsic carrier concentration in silicon follows a similar exponential relation as described in the article from the International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors (ITRS): https://www.itrs2.net/itrs-reports.html

2. **Q:** Describe the role and differences between the density of states effective mass and conductivity effective mass for electrons and holes in silicon. How do these effective masses influence device characteristics?
   **A:** The density of states effective mass (m*) determines the number of available energy states for carriers and is used to calculate carrier concentration (density of states). The conductivity effective mass relates to carrier mobility and determines how easily carriers respond to electric fields. For electrons in silicon, the density of states effective mass is about 1.08 m0 while the conductivity effective mass is about 0.26 m0; for holes, these are 0.81 m0 and 0.386 m0 respectively. The lighter conductivity effective mass for electrons compared to holes explains the higher electron mobility, impacting faster electron transport in devices.
   **External example:** The difference between effective masses is critical for MOSFET performance, as explained in the semiconductor physics guide by IEEE: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1452566

3. **Q:** What assumptions lead to the derivation of the ideal diode I–V equation for a pn-junction, and how is the reverse saturation current Is defined in terms of material and device parameters?
   **A:** The ideal diode I–V equation (\(I_d = I_s [\exp(qV_d/kT) - 1]\)) assumes a step junction profile, depletion approximation (no free carriers in the depletion region), low-level injection, negligible recombination-generation in the depletion region, no voltage drop in the bulk regions, and the neutral regions are longer than the minority carrier diffusion lengths. The reverse saturation current Is is given by \(I_s = q A_d n_i^2 \left(\frac{D_p}{N_d L_p} + \frac{D_n}{N_a L_n} \right)\) for long-base diodes, where \(A_d\) is junction area, \(D_n\), \(D_p\) are diffusion constants, \(N_d\), \(N_a\) doping concentrations, and \(L_n\), \(L_p\) are minority carrier diffusion lengths.

Pierret, available via official educational resources: https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-731-introduction-to-semiconductor-devices-and-circuits-spring-2002/

4. **Q:** Explain the formation of the built-in potential (\( \phi_{bi} \)) in a pn-junction and how doping concentrations influence the depletion region width on each side.
   **A:** When p-type and n-type semiconductors contact, diffusion of majority carriers across the junction creates fixed ionized donor and acceptor ions (space charge region), generating an electric field opposing further diffusion. This establishes an electrostatic potential difference called the built-in potential (\( \phi_{bi} \)), given by \( \phi_{bi} = V_T \ln\left(\frac{N_a N_d}{n_i^2}\right) \), where \(V_T\) is thermal voltage. The depletion widths \(x_p\) and \(x_n\) on each side vary inversely with the doping concentrations of the respective sides; higher doping results in a narrower depletion region on that side.
   **External example:** The built-in potential and depletion region dependence on doping are elaborated in the "Fundamentals of Semiconductor Devices" article by IEEE: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7147543

5. **Q:** What is the physical significance of the quasi-Fermi levels in a semiconductor under nonequilibrium conditions, and how do they relate to carrier concentrations?
   **A:** Under nonequilibrium (e.g., carrier injection or extraction), the Fermi level splits into quasi-Fermi levels \(E_{fn}\) and \(E_{fp}\) for electrons and holes, respectively, which describe carrier distributions independently. They satisfy \(n = n_i \exp\left(\frac{E_{fn} - E_i}{kT}\right)\) and \(p = n_i \exp\left(\frac{E_i - E_{fp}}{kT}\right)\), allowing accurate description of carrier concentrations when \(pn \neq n_i^2\). The difference between \(E_{fn}\) and \(E_{fp}\) relates to the excess carrier population and device operation (e.g., forward bias).
   **External example:** The concept of quasi-Fermi levels is key in solar cells and is explained in NREL's semiconductor fundamentals tutorial: https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy13osti/56487.pdf

6. **Q:** How does velocity saturation affect carrier transport in silicon at high electric fields, and what is the typical saturation velocity for electrons and holes at 300 K?
   **A:** At low electric fields (<~10^4 V/cm), carrier drift velocity increases linearly with field, governed by mobility. At higher fields, carriers gain energy faster than they lose it to lattice scattering, emitting optical phonons and reaching a velocity limit (velocity saturation), beyond which increasing the field does not increase velocity. For silicon at 300 K, the saturation velocity \(v_{sat}\) is about \(1.07 \times 10^7\) cm/s for electrons and \(8.34 \times 10^6\) cm/s for holes.
   **External example:** Velocity saturation and its impact on MOSFET performance is discussed by the IEEE in device characterization studies: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7168432

7. **Q:** Detail the generation-recombination mechanisms in indirect bandgap semiconductors like silicon and the role of Shockley–Read–Hall (SRH) recombination via deep-level traps.
   **A:** In silicon, direct band-to-band recombination is unlikely due to differing momentum states of conduction and valence band edges. Recombination predominantly occurs via deep-level traps (impurities or defects) within the bandgap that facilitate carrier capture and recombination. The SRH theory models generation-recombination through these traps, with the recombination rate depending on trap energy level, density, capture cross-section, and excess carrier concentrations. Traps near mid-gap are most effective recombination centers.
   **External example:** SRH recombination in silicon is detailed in "Physics of Semiconductor Devices" by Sze and Ng, a standard text used worldwide: https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Physics+of+Semiconductor+Devices%2C+3rd+Edition-p-9780471143239

8. **Q:** What is the depletion approximation in pn-junction analysis, and how does it simplify the calculation of electric field and potential distribution across the junction?
   **A:** The depletion approximation assumes that the space charge (depletion) region is fully depleted of free carriers (electrons and holes), containing only fixed ionized donors or acceptors, while outside this region, quasi-neutrality holds (no net charge). This simplifies Poisson’s equation, allowing piecewise constant charge density and linear electric field solutions within the depletion region, leading to explicit expressions for electric field \(E(x)\), maximum field \(E_{max}\), depletion widths \(x_p\), \(x_n\), and potential barrier \(V_{bi}\).
   **External example:** The use of the depletion approximation and its limitations is described in the "Semiconductor Fundamentals" course materials by Stanford University: https://web.stanford.edu/class/ee314/lectures/lecture5.pdf

9. **Q:** Discuss how the sheet resistance of a diffusion region in an IC is defined and how it relates to doping concentration and device geometry.
   **A:** Sheet resistance \(R_{sh}\) is defined as the resistivity divided by the thickness of the doped layer (\(R_{sh} = \rho / t\)) and has units of Ohms per square. It describes the resistance of a square area of the diffusion and is used because device length and width often vary independently. The resistivity \(\rho\) depends inversely on the doping concentration and carrier mobility, so higher doping reduces sheet resistance. Total resistance of a diffused line is \(R = R_{sh} \times (L/W)\).
   **External example:** Fundamentals of sheet resistance in diffusion layers of ICs is covered in the IEEE Electron Device Letters: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6079965

10. **Q:** How do external forward and reverse biases affect the depletion region width and electric field distribution in a pn-junction?
    **A:** Forward bias reduces the built-in potential barrier by an amount \(V_d\), shrinking the depletion width \(W_d\) as \(W_d \propto \sqrt{\phi_{bi} - V_d}\), and reducing the maximum electric field \(E_{max}\). Reverse bias increases the barrier and expands the depletion width and electric field accordingly. This modulation controls carrier injection and current flow across the junction in device operation.
    **External example:** The effect of applied bias on the depletion width and electric field is discussed in the semiconductor devices handbook by IEEE: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5373807

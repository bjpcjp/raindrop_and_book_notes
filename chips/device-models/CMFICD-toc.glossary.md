- **BJT (Bipolar Junction Transistor)** — A transistor that uses both electron and hole charge carriers for amplification or switching.
- **Charge-Based Model** — A compact MOSFET modeling approach based on charges in the device rather than voltages.
- **Compact Model** — A simplified mathematical model representing the electrical behavior of semiconductor devices for circuit simulation.
- **Depletion Region** — The area within a semiconductor where mobile charge carriers are depleted, forming an electric field.
- **Diffusion Current** — Current due to the movement of carriers from high to low concentration within a semiconductor.
- **Drain Current** — The current flowing from the drain terminal of a MOSFET device.
- **EM1 Model** — A basic DC compact model for BJTs capturing key device characteristics.
- **Flat Band Voltage** — The gate voltage at which there is no band bending in the semiconductor of a MOS capacitor.
- **Flicker Noise** — Low-frequency electrical noise observed in semiconductor devices caused by traps and defects.
- **Gate Capacitance** — The capacitance between the gate and channel in a MOSFET device.
- **Gate-Induced Drain Leakage (GIDL)** — A leakage current caused by high electric fields near the drain-gate overlap in MOSFETs.
- **MOS Capacitor** — The basic metal-oxide-semiconductor structure used to study the MOS system.
- **MOSFET (Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistor)** — A transistor commonly used in digital and analog circuits, controlled by voltage applied to a gate.
- **Non-Quasi-Static (NQS) Effect** — Deviations in transistor behavior at high frequencies where charge distribution changes cannot be considered instantaneous.

- **Sheet Resistance** — The resistance of a thin semiconductor layer expressed per square unit.
- **Short Channel Effect** — Changes in MOSFET device behavior caused by reduced channel lengths.
- **Subthreshold Region** — The operating region of a MOSFET when gate voltage is below threshold and current flows mainly due to diffusion.
- **Substrate Current** — Current flowing through the semiconductor substrate, often due to impact ionization or leakage mechanisms.
- **Surface Potential** — The electric potential at the semiconductor surface under the gate oxide in MOS devices.
- **Threshold Voltage** — The minimum gate voltage required to create a conducting channel in a MOSFET.
- **Tunnel FET (TFET)** — A transistor that uses band-to-band tunneling to switch current, offering low power operation.
- **Velocity Saturation** — The condition where carrier velocity in a semiconductor no longer increases proportionally with electric field.
- **Work Function** — The energy required to remove an electron from the material surface into vacuum.

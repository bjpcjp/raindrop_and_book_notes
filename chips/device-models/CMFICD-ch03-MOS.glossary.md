- **Accumulation** — A condition where the surface of a p-type semiconductor has increased hole concentration due to negative gate voltage, causing bands to bend upward.
- **Band Bending** — The distortion of energy bands near the semiconductor-oxide interface caused by voltage or charge differences.
- **Bulk Potential (φB)** — Electrostatic potential deep inside the semiconductor away from the surface, related to doping concentration.
- **Capacitance-Voltage (C–V) Characteristics** — The measurement of capacitance variation of an MOS capacitor as a function of applied voltage.
- **Depletion Region** — A region near the semiconductor surface depleted of majority carriers, exposing charged ions under certain bias.
- **Depletion Width (Xd)** — The spatial extent of the depletion region inside the semiconductor.
- **Electron Affinity (χ)** — The energy difference between the vacuum level and the conduction band edge at the surface of a material.
- **Flat Band Condition** — The state when energy bands are flat across the semiconductor, oxide, and metal, achieved at flat band voltage.
- **Flat Band Voltage (Vfb)** — The gate voltage at which there is no band bending in the semiconductor, defined by work function difference and oxide charges.
- **Fermi Level (Ef)** — The energy level at which the probability of electron occupancy is 50% at thermal equilibrium.
- **Fermi Potential** — Electrostatic potential corresponding to the position of the Fermi level relative to intrinsic energy.
- **Inversion Layer Thickness (Xinv)** — Thickness of the region near the surface where minority carriers accumulate, causing inversion.
- **Inversion Charge (Qi)** — Charge due to minority carriers accumulated at the semiconductor surface under strong positive gate bias.
- **Inversion Region** — Condition where the semiconductor surface behaves like the opposite doping type due to applied bias.
- **Majority Carrier** — The carrier type (electron or hole) present in the highest concentration in a semiconductor.
- **Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (MOS) Capacitor** — A device consisting of a metal gate, oxide insulator, and a semiconductor substrate that forms a voltage-dependent capacitor.
- **Minority Carrier** — The carrier type present in low concentration in a semiconductor; opposite to the majority carrier.
- **Mobile Ionic Charge (Qm)** — Positive ions, such as sodium, that can move slowly inside the oxide under an electric field.
- **Oxide Capacitance (Cox)** — Capacitance per unit area of the oxide layer formed between the gate and semiconductor.
- **Oxide-Trapped Charge (Qot)** — Charges trapped within the oxide layer, often due to defects or ionizing radiation.
- **Permittivity of Free Space (ε0)** — A physical constant representing the capability of vacuum to permit electric field lines.
- **Polysilicon Depletion Capacitance (Cpoly)** — Additional capacitance in polysilicon gate MOS capacitors due to depletion in the polysilicon layer.
- **Quantum Mechanical (QM) Effect** — Effects occurring due to quantum confinement of inversion carriers, leading to discrete energy levels and modified charge distribution.
- **Semiconductor Work Function (Φs)** — Energy needed to remove an electron from the semiconductor’s Fermi level to vacuum.
- **Surface Potential (φs)** — Electrostatic potential difference between the semiconductor surface and bulk intrinsic level, representing band bending.
- **Threshold Voltage (Vth)** — The gate voltage at which strong inversion occurs and a conductive channel forms in the MOSFET.
- **Work Function (Φ)** — The minimum energy required to remove an electron from a solid to vacuum level.
- **Work Function Difference (Φms)** — Difference between metal and semiconductor work functions, influencing band bending and flat band voltage.

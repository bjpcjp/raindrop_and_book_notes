This chapter presents compact models for small geometry MOSFET devices, detailing the modeling of threshold voltage including effects of nonuniform substrate doping, short and narrow channel phenomena, and body bias, as well as mobility degradation due to high vertical electric fields. It further develops regional drain current models accounting for high lateral electric fields and velocity saturation, and addresses hot carrier effects such as substrate current and gate leakage, providing comprehensive expressions for accurate device simulation in advanced VLSI circuit design.

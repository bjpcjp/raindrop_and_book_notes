1. **Q:** What are the main components of MOSFET capacitances and how do intrinsic and extrinsic capacitances differ in terms of their physical location and behavior?
   **A:** MOSFET capacitances are divided into intrinsic and extrinsic components. Intrinsic capacitances exist between the source/drain (S/D) metallurgical junctions within the intrinsic channel region, where the gate-to-S/D voltage is at flat band. Extrinsic capacitances lie outside this intrinsic region and include outer fringing capacitances, inner fringing capacitances, overlap capacitances (gate to heavily or lightly doped S/D and bulk), and S/D junction capacitances. Intrinsic capacitances are directly related to the device channel, while extrinsic capacitances arise from parasitic effects near the device edges and surroundings.
   **External example:** The separation of intrinsic and extrinsic MOSFET capacitances is fundamental in SPICE modeling where intrinsic capacitances affect switching, and extrinsic parasitics influence layout-dependent effects. (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1040853)

2. **Q:** Explain the quasistatic assumption in dynamic MOSFET modeling and discuss its validity and limitations based on device characteristics and operating conditions.
   **A:** The quasistatic assumption posits that terminal voltages vary slowly enough for device charges (QG, QS, QD, QB) to instantaneously follow voltage changes with no delay. This allows transient currents to be modeled as time derivatives of static charges. It works well for long-channel devices with longer transit times and low switching speeds, where capacitances dominate delay rather than charge redistribution. It breaks down for high-speed switching, small load capacitances, and short-channel or nanoscale devices where charge transit times approach or exceed waveform rise times, requiring non-quasistatic analysis.
   **External example:** The quasistatic assumption underpins MOSFET models in most circuit simulators but must be replaced by non-quasistatic models for deep-submicron MOSFETs as explained in IEEE Trans. Electron Devices. (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1720424)

3. **Q:** How does the Meyer capacitance model define intrinsic MOSFET capacitances, and what are its fundamental assumptions and known shortcomings?
   **A:** The Meyer model lumps the distributed gate-channel capacitances into three reciprocal capacitances: gate-to-source (CGS), gate-to-drain (CGD), and gate-to-bulk (CGB), defined as partial derivatives of gate charge wrt terminal voltages. It assumes capacitance reciprocity (e.g., CGD = CDG) and constant bulk charge independent of Vds, leading to zero bulk-source and bulk-drain capacitances. Shortcomings include violation of charge conservation and nonphysical reciprocity; it does not model nonreciprocal capacitances or charge partitioning, causing inaccuracies in circuits with charge storage nodes such as charge pumps or DRAM.
   **External example:** The limitations of the Meyer model are well documented in MOSFET modeling literature and have led to the development of charge-based models, as detailed in the paper “Charge-based MOSFET modeling” by T. Grasser et al. (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5612881)

4. **Q:** Describe the charge-based capacitance modeling approach for MOSFETs and explain how it overcomes the limitations of the Meyer model, focusing on charge partitioning and conservation.
   **A:** Charge-based modeling assigns terminal charges QG, QS, QD, and QB as independent state variables functions of all terminal voltages. It calculates transient currents as time derivatives of these charges, ensuring charge conservation via the relation QG + QS + QD + QB = 0. The model accurately represents 16 capacitances (4 self-capacitances and 12 nonreciprocal trans-capacitances) without assuming reciprocity. Charge partitioning uses Ward–Dutton’s approach, which integrates local inversion charge weighted by position along the channel to assign QS and QD, ensuring physically consistent separation of source and drain charges, critical for accurate transient simulations.
   **External example:** The Ward–Dutton charge partitioning method underlies widely accepted MOSFET models such as BSIM3 and BSIM4 used in industry-standard simulators. (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/27792)

5. **Q:** How are terminal charges and capacitances derived for long-channel MOSFETs in strong inversion using the regional DC current model, and how does this differ in weak inversion and accumulation regions?
   **A:** In strong inversion for long-channel devices, terminal charges QS and QD are derived by integrating charge density Qi over the channel weighted by position (Ward–Dutton partition), expressed as functions of Vgs, Vth, Vds with mobility µ and Cox, accounting for channel voltage variation V(y). Gate and bulk charges QG and QB are obtained similarly, linked via charge conservation. In weak inversion, Qi ≈ 0 and Qb dominates; charges depend exponentially on Vgs and weakly on Vds, modeled assuming diffusion current with ideality factor n. In accumulation, QG = −QB is a linear function of gate and substrate bias since inversion charge is negligible.
   **External example:** Charge-based models incorporating regional DC approximations for long-channel MOSFETs are standard in modeling textbooks such as “Device Electronics for Integrated Circuits” by R.F. Pierret. (https://books.google.com/books?id=A-mTDAAAQBAJ)

6. **Q:** What modifications are necessary to the long-channel charge and capacitance models to accurately represent short-channel MOSFET devices, and how are velocity saturation and channel length modulation incorporated?
   **A:** Short-channel effects are included by modifying parameters in the charge model to account for velocity saturation and channel length modulation—specifically, introducing factors α and Ec related to effective mobility and critical electric field. The Ids and dy/dV relations incorporate velocity saturation via μ_eff and Ec, modifying the variable substitution in charge integrals. Parameters A′ and B′ in terminal charge expressions adjust for these effects, reducing charge compared to long-channel devices and altering capacitances accordingly. Channel length modulation and series resistance are also implicitly included in μ_eff. These corrections ensure convergence to long-channel behavior when saturation effects vanish.
   **External example:** Inclusion of velocity saturation and channel length modulation in short-channel MOSFET modeling is discussed in BSIM short-channel models widely used in industry. (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1040853)

7. **Q:** How is the MOSFET source/drain overlap capacitance modeled, including all parasitic components, and what factors influence its bias dependence?
   **A:** Overlap capacitance comprises three components: (1) direct parallel plate overlap capacitance Cov proportional to effective overlap length (lov + Δ), (2) outer fringing capacitance Cfo between gate and S/D outer edges, and (3) inner fringing capacitance Cfi along the channel (sidewall) interface. These are modeled analytically using physical constants, oxide thickness, junction depth, and angles α, β representing polysilicon slope and material dielectric ratios. Cfi is typically larger and decreases with increasing gate voltage, introducing bias dependence. Additional overlap capacitance between gate and bulk CGBO can be included but is often negligible.
   **External example:** Gate overlap capacitance including fringing fields is critical in high-frequency MOSFET design and elaborated by T. Skotnicki et al. in IEEE J. Solid-State Circuits. (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4558320)

8. **Q:** What are the primary reasons the Meyer capacitance model can produce nonphysical simulation results in circuits with charge storage nodes, and how does the charge-based model resolve these issues?
   **A:** The Meyer model can violate charge conservation due to incorrect assignment of charges and assumes symmetric (reciprocal) capacitances which are not physically accurate for multi-terminal MOSFETs. This causes incorrect prediction of charge build-up, especially in storage nodes like charge pumps and DRAM circuits. The charge-based model remedies this by (i) explicitly calculating terminal charges that depend on all terminal voltages, (ii) enforcing charge conservation (sum of terminal charges zero), and (iii) allowing nonreciprocal capacitance elements, thus accurately reflecting dynamic charge redistribution and avoiding unphysical effects.
   **External example:** Charge conservation violations in Meyer’s model and its resolution via charge-based models are addressed in the BSIM charge-based modeling framework. (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1341134)

9. **Q:** Explain the formulation and physical significance of the source/drain-body pn-junction capacitance model in MOSFETs, including modulation due to bias and temperature.
   **A:** The pn-junction capacitance includes bottom junction and sidewall capacitances on the isolation and gate edges. Each component is modeled by an empirical expression involving zero-bias capacitance Cj0, junction potential φbi, and grading coefficient mj with dependence on the bias voltage Vd to reflect depletion width modulation, using different forms for reverse and forward bias through series expansion to maintain physical continuity. Junction perimeter and area scaling factors (Aseff, Pseff) and temperature-dependent parameters account for device geometry and operating conditions. These models capture nonlinear capacitance variations under different biasing relevant for device transient response.
   **External example:** MOSFET pn-junction capacitance modeling for parametric extraction and simulation is detailed in the JEDEC standard JESD31. (https://www.jedec.org/standards-documents/docs/jesd31)

10. **Q:** How are the terminal current components at each MOSFET electrode expressed in charge-based modeling, and what is the capacitance matrix structure that results from these relations?
    **A:** Terminal currents ij are expressed as time derivatives of terminal charges Qj, which depend on all terminal voltages: ij = dQj/dt = Σ(∂Qj/∂Vk)dVk/dt for k = G, S, D, B. This leads to a 4×4 capacitance matrix Cij, where each element Cij = ∂Qi/∂Vj (with a negative sign for i ≠ j) represents the incremental capacitance coupling terminal i to voltage at terminal j, including self-capacitances (diagonal terms) summing all trans-capacitances connected to that terminal. The capacitance matrix is reference independent (rows sum to zero) and charge conserving (columns sum to zero). Off-diagonal elements are nonreciprocal, reflecting physical asymmetry in charge modulation by different terminals.
    **External example:** The indefinite admittance matrix formulation for multi-terminal MOSFET capacitances is foundational in compact modeling, such as in BSIM4 models. (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1040853)

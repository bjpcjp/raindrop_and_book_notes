This chapter discusses compact modeling techniques for MOSFET devices in analog and RF applications, focusing on noise characterization, non-quasistatic (NQS) effects, and parasitic elements relevant at high frequencies. It presents fundamental noise models including thermal and flicker noise, an NQS model based on Elmoreâ€™s equivalent RC circuit, and scalable approaches for modeling gate and substrate resistances to improve accuracy in RF circuit simulations.

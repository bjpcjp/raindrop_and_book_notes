- **AC Analysis** — Circuit analysis involving small signal variations around a steady-state operating point.  
- **Bulk (Body)** — The semiconductor substrate of a MOSFET, connected to the bulk terminal.  
- **Capacitance Reciprocity** — An assumption that capacitances are symmetric (Cij = Cji), often invalid in MOSFET modeling.  
- **Charge Conservation** — Principle that the total charge in the device terminals sums to zero.  
- **Charge Partitioning** — Dividing the total channel charge into source and drain charges for modeling.  
- **Charge-Based Capacitance Model** — A MOSFET capacitance model that uses terminal charges as state variables ensuring charge conservation.  
- **Channel Charge (QI)** — The charge stored in the inversion layer of the MOSFET channel.  
- **Channel Length Modulation (CLM)** — Short channel effect where effective channel length decreases with increasing drain voltage.  
- **Dynamic Model** — A device model accounting for time-varying terminal voltages and stored charges.  
- **Extrinsic Capacitances** — MOSFET capacitances outside the intrinsic region, including overlap, fringing, and junction capacitances.  
- **Fringing Capacitance** — Parasitic capacitance caused by electric field lines extending beyond the edges of the gate electrode.  
- **Gate-to-Bulk Overlap Capacitance (CGBO)** — Capacitance due to gate overlap on the bulk or substrate region.  
- **Gate Oxide Capacitance (Cox)** — Capacitance per unit area of the MOSFET's gate oxide layer.  
- **Intrinsic Capacitances** — Capacitances existing strictly between source and drain metallurgical junctions under the gate.  
- **Meyer Model** — A simple, lumped intrinsic capacitance model assuming reciprocal capacitances but violating charge conservation.  
- **Mobility Degradation** — Reduction of carrier mobility in a MOSFET due to high vertical electric fields.  
- **Non-Quasistatic Model** — A model considering delay in charge redistribution, important at high frequencies or for very short channel devices.  
- **Overlap Capacitance (CGSO, CGDO)** — Capacitances due to the overlap between gate and heavily doped source/drain regions.  
- **Quasistatic Assumption** — The assumption that charge instantaneously follows changes in terminal voltages without delay.  
- **Short Channel Effects (SCE)** — Device behaviors significant in MOSFETs with very small channel lengths, including velocity saturation and CLM.  
- **Source-Drain Junction Capacitance (CJS, CJD)** — Capacitance due to depletion regions at the source-body and drain-body pn-junctions.  
- **Transit Time (τt)** — Average time for carriers to travel through the MOSFET channel, relevant for dynamic operation.  
- **Velocity Saturation** — Condition where carrier velocity becomes limited at high electric fields in short channel devices.  
- **Ward-Dutton Partitioning** — A method for charge partitioning based on continuity equations ensuring physically meaningful terminal charges.

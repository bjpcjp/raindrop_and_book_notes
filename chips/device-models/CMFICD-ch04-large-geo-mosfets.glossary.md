- **Body Bias (Vbs)** — Voltage applied at the substrate or body terminal to modulate the inversion layer and device behavior.  
- **Body Factor (γ)** — Parameter describing the effect of substrate doping and oxide thickness on threshold voltage.  
- **Bulk Charge (Qb)** — Charge due to the depletion region in the substrate beneath the MOSFET channel.  
- **Channel Length Modulation (CLM)** — Effect causing the effective channel length to shorten as drain voltage increases, increasing drain current in saturation.  
- **Channel Potential (Vch(y))** — Voltage variation along the MOSFET channel length due to source-to-drain bias.  
- **Charge-Sheet Model** — Simplified MOSFET model assuming inversion layer as a zero-thickness sheet of charge to calculate current.  
- **Depletion Region** — Area in the substrate where mobile carriers are depleted near the semiconductor-oxide interface.  
- **Diffusion Current (Ids2)** — Component of MOSFET current dominant in weak inversion, caused by carrier concentration gradients.  
- **Drain Current (Ids)** — Current flowing from the drain to the source terminals of a MOSFET device.  
- **Drain Voltage (Vds)** — Voltage applied between the drain and source terminals of a MOSFET.  
- **Drain-Source Terminals** — Two heavily doped regions providing source and drain contacts in a MOSFET.  
- **Electric Field (Ex, Ey)** — Electric fields along the depth (x) and length (y) directions affecting carrier movement.  
- **Gradual Channel Approximation (GCA)** — Assumption that electric field varies mostly along the depth direction, simplifying MOSFET modeling.  
- **Inversion Layer** — Thin conductive channel of minority carriers formed at the semiconductor-oxide interface under sufficient gate bias.  
- **Inversion Charge (Qi)** — Mobile charge density in the inversion layer contributing to current flow.  
- **Mobility (μs)** — Carrier mobility specifically at the semiconductor surface (inversion layer).  
- **Origin of Threshold Voltage (Vth)** — Gate voltage at which inversion layer first forms and device begins conduction.  
- **Pao-Sah Model** — Comprehensive MOSFET drain current model based on double integral of carrier charge, applicable across all operation regimes.  
- **Pinch-Off Voltage (Vdsat)** — Drain voltage at which the MOSFET channel pinches off near the drain, starting saturation.  
- **Process Transconductance (κ)** — Parameter combining surface mobility and oxide capacitance affecting device gain.  
- **Saturation Region** — MOSFET operating region where drain current is nearly constant for increasing drain voltages beyond pinch-off.  
- **Source Terminal (Vs)** — Terminal providing minority carriers to form the inversion layer in MOSFETs.  
- **Subthreshold (Weak Inversion) Region** — Device operation region below threshold voltage where current flows mainly by diffusion and is exponential in gate voltage.  
- **Subthreshold Slope (S)** — Gate voltage change needed to vary drain current by one decade in the subthreshold region, indicating device switching efficiency.  
- **Surface Potential (φs)** — Electrostatic potential at the semiconductor-oxide interface controlling inversion layer formation.  
- **Threshold Voltage without Body Bias (Vth0)** — Threshold voltage assuming zero body (substrate) bias condition.  
- **Transconductance Parameter (β)** — Gain factor depending on device geometry and process parameters, controlling current magnitude.  
- **Two-Terminal MOS Capacitor** — Basic MOS structure used as reference to understand MOSFET operation with inversion conditions.  
- **Weak Inversion Current** — Drain current under gate bias below threshold, dominated by diffusion with exponential behavior.

- **Bandgap (Eg)** — The energy difference between the valence band and conduction band of a semiconductor, affecting tunneling probability in TFETs.  
- **Boltzmann Distribution** — Statistical distribution describing carrier energies in MOSFETs, limiting subthreshold slope to 60 mV/decade.  
- **Channel** — The intrinsic semiconductor region between source and drain in TFETs where conduction occurs.  
- **Drain** — The terminal of a TFET where current exits; corresponds to heavily doped n+ or p+ region depending on device type.  
- **Double Gate (DG)** — A transistor structure having two gates controlling the channel, improving electrostatics and reducing short channel effects.  
- **Energy Band Diagram** — A graphical representation of energy levels in a semiconductor device, showing conduction, valence bands, and Fermi levels.  
- **Fermi Level (Ef)** — The energy level at which the probability of finding an electron is 50% at absolute zero temperature.  
- **Gate** — The electrode in a TFET that modulates the channel energy bands and tunneling probability via applied voltage.  
- **Heterostructure TFET** — A device with different semiconductor materials at the source, channel, and drain to optimize band alignment and improve performance.  
- **Intrinsic Channel (i-channel)** — The undoped or lightly doped semiconductor region in a TFET between source and drain.  
- **Interband Tunneling (Band-to-Band Tunneling, BTBT)** — Quantum mechanical process where carriers tunnel between valence and conduction bands across a junction.  
- **Mobility (μ)** — Carrier mobility indicating how quickly electrons or holes move through a semiconductor under electric field.  
- **Natural Length (λ)** — Also called screening length; characterizes the spatial extent of the electric field effect in the channel relevant for tunneling barrier width.  
- **Off-Current (Ioff)** — The leakage current flowing through a TFET when it is in the off-state (no tunneling occurs).  
- **ON-Current (Ion)** — The current flowing in a TFET when it is switched on and tunneling conduction dominates.  
- **p-i-n Structure** — Semiconductor device with p-doped source, intrinsic channel, and n-doped drain regions forming a tunnel junction.  
- **Phonon-Assisted Tunneling** — Tunneling process assisted by lattice vibrations, essential in indirect bandgap semiconductors like silicon.  
- **Pocket Region** — A degenerately doped area near the tunnel junction designed to align electric fields and enhance tunneling.  
- **Quantum Tunneling** — A quantum effect allowing particles to cross energy barriers higher than their kinetic energy.  
- **Reverse Bias** — A voltage applied to a p-n junction that increases the barrier potential preventing carrier flow, essential for tunneling in TFETs.  
- **Screening Length (λ)** — See Natural Length; also refers to the distance over which electric fields decay in TFET channels.  
- **Source** — The terminal of a TFET where carriers originate; doped opposite to drain (p+ or n+ depending on device type).  
- **Subthreshold Swing (S)** — The gate voltage change needed to increase the drain current by one decade, measured in mV/decade; TFETs can achieve S < 60 mV/decade.  
- **Surface Potential (us)** — Electrostatic potential at the semiconductor surface influenced by gate voltage, crucial for TFET operation modeling.  
- **Tunnel FET (TFET)** — A transistor that operates by quantum mechanical tunneling through a reverse-biased junction instead of thermal injection.  
- **Tunneling Probability (T(E))** — The likelihood of a carrier tunneling through the energy barrier at the source-channel junction in a TFET.  
- **Tunneling Window (ΔΦ)** — The energy range over which the valence band of the source overlaps with the conduction band of the channel allowing tunneling.  
- **Valence Band (Ev)** — The highest range of electron energies in a semiconductor that are normally filled with electrons.  
- **Vertical TFET** — A TFET device structure where current flows vertically through layers rather than laterally.  
- **Work Function (Vfb)** — The energy difference between the Fermi level and vacuum level influencing flat band voltage in device modeling.

The index outlines key topics related to semiconductor devices, including advanced models and physical effects of bipolar junction transistors (BJTs) and MOSFETs, such as accumulation charge, band-to-band tunneling, and thermal noise. It also highlights important concepts like breakdown voltage, body effect, bulk charge phenomena, and widely used compact models such as the Ebersâ€“Moll and Berkeley Short Channel IGFET Model (BSIM).

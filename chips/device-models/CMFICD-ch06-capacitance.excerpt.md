This chapter presents dynamic compact MOSFET capacitance models essential for analyzing device performance under time-varying terminal voltages, distinguishing between intrinsic and extrinsic capacitances and addressing limitations of the widely used Meyer model. It further develops more accurate charge-based capacitance models for both long and short channel devices, discusses quasistatic assumptions, and includes modeling of extrinsic capacitances such as source/drain overlap and pn-junction capacitances.

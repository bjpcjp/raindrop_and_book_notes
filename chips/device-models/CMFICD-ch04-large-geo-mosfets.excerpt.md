This chapter presents the development of large geometry MOSFET compact models, including the basic device structure, threshold voltage modeling for long-channel devices, and detailed derivations of drain current models such as the Pao-Sah double integral and Brews charge-sheet models. Simplified regional models for circuit CAD are also derived, explaining the operation in weak, moderate, and strong inversion regions along with effects like body bias and channel length modulation, providing foundational equations widely used in MOSFET device analysis and circuit simulation.

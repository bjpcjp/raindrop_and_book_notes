This chapter presents surface potentialâ€“based compact models for ultrathin-body field-effect transistors (FETs), including multigate FinFETs and UTB-SOI FETs, which address major scaling challenges of conventional planar MOSFETs by enhancing electrostatic control and suppressing short-channel effects. It details the electrostatics, drain current, and dynamic capacitance models for common and independent multigate devices, incorporating real-device effects such as volume inversion, quantum mechanical confinement, mobility degradation, and series resistances for accurate circuit analysis.

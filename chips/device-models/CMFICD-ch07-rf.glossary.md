- **1/f Noise (Flicker Noise)** — Low-frequency noise in MOSFETs with power spectral density inversely proportional to frequency, caused by carrier trapping and mobility fluctuations.
- **A (Flicker Noise Parameter)** — Technology-dependent coefficient used in modeling the equivalent oxide-trap density for flicker noise.
- **Body Transconductance (gmb)** — Conductance related to the bulk or substrate effect on the MOSFET current.
- **Bulk Charging Current** — The current related to charging the body or substrate region, often negligible in NQS modeling.
- **Channel Charge (Qi)** — Total charge present in the inversion layer of the MOSFET channel per unit area.
- **Channel Length (Leff)** — The effective length of the MOSFET channel where conduction occurs.
- **Channel Resistance (Rst)** — Static (DC) resistance of the MOSFET channel derived from the voltage drop and drain current.
- **Charge Partitioning Ratios (Dxpart, Sxpart, Gxpart)** — Fractions of channel charge assigned to drain, source, and gate respectively, summing to one.
- **Diffusion Resistance (Red)** — Additional channel resistance due to diffusion current caused by AC excitation of gate voltage.
- **Drift Relaxation Time (τdrift)** — Time constant representing the effect of carrier drift on the channel charge response.
- **Elmore Equivalent Circuit** — A simplified RC model approximating the distributed channel resistance and capacitance to model NQS effect.
- **Flicker Noise Coefficient (Kf)** — Parameter quantifying the magnitude of flicker noise in MOSFETs.
- **Gate Capacitances (Cgs, Cgd, Cgb)** — Capacitances between gate-source, gate-drain, and gate-body terminals respectively.
- **Gate Resistance (Rg)** — Resistance of the gate electrode including distributed resistance and channel-related effective resistance.
- **Inversion Layer Capacitance (Cinv)** — Capacitance associated with the inversion charge layer in the MOSFET channel.
- **Interface Trap Capacitance (Cit)** — Capacitance due to traps at the silicon-oxide interface affecting charge fluctuations.
- **Interface Traps (Nt)** — Electronic traps at the Si-SiO2 interface that capture and emit carriers, causing flicker noise.
- **Mobility (μ, μeff)** — Carrier mobility in the channel, often effective mobility accounting for scattering effects.
- **Noise Power Spectral Density (PSD)** — Measure of noise power per unit frequency, used for current (Si) or voltage noise (Sv).
- **Non-Quasistatic (NQS) Effect** — Delay in channel charge response to voltage changes due to finite carrier transit time, important at high frequencies.
- **Oxide Charge Scattering Mobility (μox)** — Mobility component limited by scattering from oxide charges.
- **Power Spectral Density (PSD)** — Frequency distribution of noise power in units such as A²/Hz or V²/Hz.
- **Relaxation Time (τ)** — Characteristic time constant describing how channel charge responds to changes in voltage in NQS models.
- **Sheet Resistance (ρsh,gate)** — Resistance per square of the gate material used to calculate gate resistance.
- **Substrate Resistance Network (RSB, RDB, RBDS)** — Resistive components modeling substrate losses between source, drain, and bulk.
- **Thermal Noise** — Noise arising from random thermal motion of carriers in resistive materials, proportional to temperature.
- **Transconductance (gm)** — Derivative of drain current with respect to gate voltage, indicating device gain.
- **Transmission-Line Model** — Distributed RC network modeling the channel in MOSFETs, approximated in NQS modeling.
- **Unified Flicker Noise Model** — Model combining carrier number and mobility fluctuations to characterize 1/f noise behavior.

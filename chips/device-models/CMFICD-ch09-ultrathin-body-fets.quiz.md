1. **Q:** Explain the key motivations for developing ultrathin-body (UTB) FETs such as FinFETs and UTB-SOI MOSFETs over conventional planar MOSFETs, highlighting the primary scaling challenges these devices address.
   **A:** UTB FETs including FinFETs and UTB-SOI MOSFETs have been developed as alternatives to planar MOSFETs to overcome fundamental device-physics constraints encountered in continuous scaling, notably short-channel effects (SCEs) such as threshold voltage roll-off and subthreshold swing degradation. These ultrathin structures offer stronger electrostatic control over the channel by limiting semiconductor thickness near the gate, reducing leakage currents and mitigating process variability like random discrete doping (RDD). This enables continued scaling in the decananometer regime without excessively thinning gate dielectrics or requiring aggressive channel doping profiles.
   **External example:** Intel’s move to FinFETs for 22-nm technology nodes was motivated by suppressing SCE and leakage issues limiting planar technology scaling. https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6104777

2. **Q:** Derive and explain the physical significance of the FinFET scaling rule given by \( t_{fin} \ll L/2 \) and how it relates to suppressing short channel effects.
   **A:** The scaling rule \( t_{fin} \ll L/2 \) arises from the conditions that the fin thickness must be fully depleted by the gate bias (so depletion width \( X_{ch,g} \geq t_{fin}/2 \)) and that the neutral (non-depleted) channel length must be sufficiently long to prevent source-drain punchthrough (\( X_{ch,g} \ll L/2 - Y_{ch,sd} \)). Combining these yields \( t_{fin} \ll L/2 \), ensuring that the thin fin does not allow leakage paths far from the gate, thus maintaining effective electrostatic control and suppressing SCEs such as threshold voltage roll-off and subthreshold swing degradation.
   **External example:** A similar scaling guideline is discussed in advanced transistor scaling literature highlighting thin-body architectures as key to electrostatic integrity: https://doi.org/10.1109/TED.2002.803651

3. **Q:** Describe the method and assumptions used in formulating the surface potential–based compact model for symmetric double-gate (DG) FinFETs, emphasizing how Poisson’s equation and channel doping assumptions are applied.
   **A:** The core model uses the gradual channel approximation and solves 1D Poisson’s equation along the vertical direction in the channel, assuming a uniform, lightly doped or undoped p-type channel where minority carrier concentration is approximated via Boltzmann statistics. Due to full depletion, doping effects on the potential can be neglected, simplifying Poisson’s equation to focus on inversion charge terms. The electrostatic potential is decomposed into parts due to inversion charge and body doping, with the body doping part neglected in fully depleted fins, leading to closed-form or implicit expressions for surface potential solved via iterative numerical methods.
   **External example:** The use of surface potential modeling with gradual channel approximation is standard in MOSFET compact modeling: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1612733

4. **Q:** Explain the concept of volume inversion in DG-MOSFETs with lightly doped channels and discuss its impact on subthreshold current and device scaling.
   **A:** Volume inversion refers to the phenomenon where inversion charge density and potential are nearly uniform throughout the ultrathin body thickness, rather than confined at the interface as in bulk devices. In lightly doped DG-MOSFETs with thin fins, small changes in gate voltage raise the potential across the entire body, causing inversion throughout the volume. This results in subthreshold drain current proportional to the body thickness and minimal potential drop inside the fin, improving electrostatic control and enabling better device scaling with near-ideal subthreshold slope.
   **External example:** Experimental nanowire transistors exhibit volume inversion with improved subthreshold swings and drive currents: https://doi.org/10.1038/nature10039

5. **Q:** Identify and describe the key physical effects modeled in the real-device submodels for multigate FETs and their influence on device performance.
   **A:** The key physical effects include short channel effects (SCE) such as threshold voltage roll-off and subthreshold slope degradation caused by drain-induced barrier lowering and drain electric field penetration; quantum mechanical effects (QME) including electrical confinement and structural confinement that increase threshold voltage and reduce gate capacitance; mobility degradation from Coulomb, phonon, and surface roughness scattering affecting drive current; and series resistances arising from source/drain extensions and contacts. These effects degrade performance if unaccounted for and are modeled to refine accuracy in compact device models.

6. **Q:** Compare the common multiple-gate (CMG) and independent multiple-gate (IMG) FET models focusing on their gate biasing conditions, structural differences, and model approaches for surface potential.
   **A:** CMG models assume that all gates (double, triple, or quadruple) are electrically connected and share identical gate work functions and oxide thicknesses, simplifying to a single uniform gate bias and symmetric potential distribution. IMG models handle independently biased gates with potentially different gate dielectric thicknesses and work functions, reflecting the asymmetric electrostatics. The IMG model assumes weak body doping and uses approximations like capacitive divider relations for back surface potential, resulting in coupled implicit equations for front and back surface potentials solved iteratively.
   **External example:** Independent gating to tune device characteristics is demonstrated in dual-gate UTB transistors: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6758434

7. **Q:** How is the drain current \( I_{ds} \) modeled in long-channel DG-FETs within the compact model framework and what approximations are used to address the implicit inversion charge expressions?
   **A:** \( I_{ds} \) is derived from the drift-diffusion equation integrated along the channel using inversion charge \( Q_i(y) \) and low-field mobility. The inversion charge is implicitly dependent on surface potential and bias, leading to an implicit equation solved iteratively. Approximate analytic forms unify charge expressions across doping regimes, and simplified formulas enable analytical integration of \( dV_{ch}/dQ_i \), yielding an expression for \( I_{ds} \) valid across subthreshold, linear, and saturation regions for fully and lightly depleted bodies.
   **External example:** Similar inversion charge-based drain current models are used in BSIM-CMG compact models: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6676665

8. **Q:** What are the main approximations and the mathematical form used in deriving the dynamic capacitance (C–V) model for common multiple-gate FinFETs?
   **A:** The dynamic model calculates terminal charges by integrating potential-dependent gate charges along the channel and applies Ward-Dutton partitioning to divide inversion charge between source and drain. A simplified drain current expression allows analytical relation of surface potential along the channel. Terminal charges are expressed as continuous polynomial forms in source and drain surface potentials, enabling consistent and charge-conserving capacitance matrix derivation used for transient circuit simulation.

9. **Q:** Discuss how quantum mechanical effects (QME) affect threshold voltage and gate capacitance in ultrathin-body DG-FETs, distinguishing between electrical and structural confinement.
   **A:** QME results in carrier confinement in discrete subbands raising the threshold voltage and reducing gate capacitance by shifting the inversion charge centroid away from the interface. Electrical confinement arises from band bending under vertical electric fields near the interfaces, whereas structural confinement results from the physical ultrathin channel dimensions bounding carriers in a rectangular quantum well. Both effects must be modeled to accurately predict device electrostatics and current.
   **External example:** Quantum confinement effects increasing Vth in nanoscale MOSFETs are discussed in this IEEE paper: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1285539

10. **Q:** Explain the importance and modeling approach of series resistances in UTB-FETs and how raised source/drain structures mitigate these effects.
    **A:** Series resistance in thin-body devices significantly impacts device drive current. Raised source/drain regions reduce parasitic resistances by increasing contact volume and carrier injection area. The total series resistance model includes bias-dependent extension resistance (modulated by fringe fields), bias-independent spreading resistance (due to current crowding), and contact resistance (interface and bulk), modeled analytically with fitting parameters to capture their combined effect on overall device performance.
    **External example:** Raised source/drain technology is a standard technique to reduce parasitic resistance in FinFETs: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5918920

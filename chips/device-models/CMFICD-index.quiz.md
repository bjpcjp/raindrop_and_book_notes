3. **Q:** Describe how short channel effects in MOSFETs are connected to bulk-charge sharing and coefficients as discussed in the text.
   **A:** Short channel effects in MOSFETs are caused by bulk-charge sharing (183) and are influenced by bulk-charge coefficient and effect (160–162, 201–202). The bulk-charge coefficient impacts threshold voltage and device characteristics, and bulk mobility (33) also affects transistor performance in scaled devices.

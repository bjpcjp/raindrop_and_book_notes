Compact models are simplified physics-based mathematical descriptions of circuit elements used in integrated circuit design to accurately simulate device behavior, including the effects of geometry, bias, temperature, and parasitic components, enabling efficient analysis and optimization in electronic design automation tools. The development and standardization of these models, evolving from early threshold voltageâ€“based equations to advanced surface potential and charge-based approaches, address the increasing complexities of nanoscale MOSFET devices and ensure accurate, scalable, and robust circuit simulation.

This chapter discusses compact modeling approaches for process variability in scaled MOSFETs, emphasizing the impact of both systematic and random front-end process variations on device and circuit performance in advanced VLSI technologies. It presents methodologies to characterize, model, and simulate these variabilities using statistical compact models for variability-aware circuit design and highlights techniques to mitigate variability risks in nanoscale CMOS devices.

- **Base Charge (QB)** — Total charge stored in the transistor's base region, including equilibrium and excess carrier charges.  
- **Base Current (IB)** — The current flowing into the base terminal of a BJT, controlling the device operation.  
- **Base-Emitter Junction (EB junction)** — The pn-junction between the base and emitter regions of a BJT.  
- **Base-Emitter Voltage (VBE)** — The voltage across the base-emitter junction, forward biasing controls BJT conduction.  
- **Base-Width Modulation** — Variation of the neutral base width due to collector-base voltage changes, affecting transistor gain (also called Early effect).  
- **Built-in Electric Field** — Internal electric field in the BJT base that influences carrier transport due to doping gradients.  
- **Charge Control Model** — A physics-based approach modeling transistor currents based on charge storage in regions like base and junctions.  
- **Collector Current (IC)** — The current flowing from the collector terminal of a BJT, mainly controlled by the base current.  
- **Collector-Base Junction (CB junction)** — The pn-junction between the collector and base regions of a BJT.  
- **Collector-Base Voltage (VBC)** — The voltage across the base-collector junction.  
- **Collector-Emitter Voltage (VCE)** — Voltage difference between the collector and emitter terminals.  
- **Depletion Region** — The charge-free region near a pn-junction where mobile carriers are depleted.  
- **Diffusion Capacitance (CDE, CDC)** — Capacitance due to stored minority carriers in forward or reverse biased junctions affecting transient response.  
- **Early Effect** — The modulation of the BJT’s effective base width and current gain by the collector-base voltage.  
- **Emitter Current (IE)** — The current flowing from the emitter terminal, the sum of collector and base currents.  
- **Ebers–Moll (EM) Model** — A large-signal physics-based model for BJTs that describes terminal currents via two back-to-back pn-junctions.  
- **Forward Current Gain (βF)** — The ratio of collector current to base current in forward active mode.  
- **Gummel Plot** — A graph of collector and base currents versus base-emitter voltage, used for extracting BJT parameters.  
- **High-Level Injection** — Operating condition where the injected minority carrier density is comparable to majority carrier density, causing β roll-off.  
- **Hybrid-π Model** — Small-signal equivalent circuit model of a BJT used for AC analysis.  
- **Intrinsic Base Width (WB)** — The neutral region width of the base that controls carrier transit and transistor speed.  
- **Knee-Current (IKF, IKR)** — The collector (or emitter) current at which the transition from low- to high-level injection occurs, marking β roll-off.  
- **Localized Recombination Current** — Additional currents due to carrier recombination in space-charge regions or surfaces increasing base current.  
- **Minority Carriers** — Charge carriers (electrons or holes) present in a region where they are the minority charge type.  
- **Normal Active Mode** — BJT operation with forward-biased EB-junction and reverse-biased CB-junction, amplifying region.  
- **Parasitic Resistances (re, rb, rc)** — Bulk resistances in emitter, base, and collector regions that affect voltage drops and device performance.  
- **Saturation Current (IS, ISS)** — Reverse saturation current of a pn-junction; fundamental parameter in diode and BJT equations.  
- **Small-Signal Transconductance (gm)** — The incremental ratio of collector current change to base-emitter voltage change under small excitations.  
- **Space-Charge Region Recombination** — Carrier recombination occurring in the depletion region affecting low-current behavior.  
- **Spice Gummel–Poon (SGP) Model** — An advanced compact BJT model integrating charge control, base-width modulation, and high-level injection effects.  
- **Transit Time (τB, τFdc, τRdc)** — Time taken by carriers to transit through the base region, affecting frequency response and diffusion capacitance.  
- **Transit Time Effects** — Inclusion of carrier transit delays through device regions affecting transient and high-frequency behavior.

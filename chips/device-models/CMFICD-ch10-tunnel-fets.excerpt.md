This chapter provides an overview of tunnel field-effect transistors (TFETs) as promising beyond-CMOS devices, emphasizing their fundamental operating principles, steep subthreshold swing below 60 mV/decade, and energy-efficient switching mechanisms based on interband tunneling. It also discusses the evolving device structures, design considerations for optimizing performance, and emerging compact modeling techniques essential for integrating TFETs into circuit CAD and future low-voltage integrated circuits.

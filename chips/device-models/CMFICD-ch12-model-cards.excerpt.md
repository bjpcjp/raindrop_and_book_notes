This chapter provides an overview of generating a statistical compact MOSFET model library based on BSIM4 for circuit simulation, detailing the methodology from data collection and parameter extraction to model validation and usage in circuit CAD tools like HSPICE. It includes guidelines for modeling process variability, mismatch effects, and the development of model cards incorporating corner cases and Monte Carlo analysis for advanced CMOS technologies.

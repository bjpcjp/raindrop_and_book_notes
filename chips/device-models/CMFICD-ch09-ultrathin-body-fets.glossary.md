- **Band bending** — The change in energy bands in a semiconductor near an interface, affecting carrier distribution.
- **Body doping (Nb)** — The concentration of dopants in the transistor channel or body region.
- **Buried oxide (BOX)** — The insulating oxide layer beneath the silicon film in SOI structures, used also as a back-gate oxide.
- **Common multiple-gate (CMG) structure** — A multigate FET where all gates are electrically connected and share the same voltage.
- **Depletion width (Xd)** — The extent of the depleted region in the semiconductor under bias.
- **Drain-induced barrier lowering (DIBL)** — Reduction of the potential barrier at the source due to the drain voltage, causing leakage.
- **Drain current (Ids)** — The current flowing from drain to source in a FET, controlled by gate voltage.
- **Drain-to-source voltage (Vds)** — The voltage applied between drain and source terminals.
- **FinFET** — A multigate FET with a thin silicon fin serving as the channel, offering improved gate control.
- **Gate oxide capacitance (Cox)** — The capacitance per unit area of the gate dielectric.
- **Gradual channel approximation (GCA)** — A modeling assumption that the potential varies slowly along the channel length compared to vertical direction.
- **Independent multiple-gate (IMG) structure** — A multigate FET with independently biased gates having different dielectric thicknesses.
- **Intrinsic capacitance** — Capacitance related to the transistor channel and gate, excluding parasitic contributions.
- **Lateral channel depletion (Ych,d)** — The depletion region spreading laterally near source and drain ends.
- **Multigate FET** — A transistor architecture with two or more gates controlling the channel, enhancing electrostatics.
- **Poisson’s equation** — A fundamental equation relating electric potential to charge distribution in semiconductors.
- **Short channel effects (SCEs)** — Device performance degradations due to shrinking channel length, such as threshold voltage roll-off.
- **Silicon-on-insulator (SOI)** — Technology where a thin silicon film is separated from bulk substrate by an oxide layer.
- **Subthreshold swing (S)** — The gate voltage change needed to increase the drain current by one decade below threshold.
- **Surface potential (ϕs)** — The electrostatic potential at the semiconductor-insulator interface.
- **Thermal voltage (vkT)** — A voltage scale equal to kT/q, where k is Boltzmann constant and T temperature, governing carrier statistics.
- **Threshold voltage (Vth)** — The gate voltage at which a FET channel begins to strongly invert and conduct.
- **Ultrathin body (UTB)** — A very thin semiconductor film used as a transistor channel to improve electrostatics.
- **Volume inversion** — A condition in thin-body FETs where the entire body volume participates in inversion charge, not just the surface.
- **Work function (ΦM)** — The energy required to remove an electron from the metal gate to vacuum, influencing flat-band voltage.
- **Wy (channel depletion width)** — The width of the depletion region along the channel due to drain bias.
- **Gate work function** — The intrinsic potential of the gate metal influencing threshold voltage.
- **Quantum mechanical effects (QME)** — Effects arising from carrier confinement and discrete energy levels in ultrathin channels.
- **Source-drain resistance** — The parasitic resistance from source/drain extensions to contacts affecting device performance.

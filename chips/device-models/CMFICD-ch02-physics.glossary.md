- **Acceptors** — Impurities from group III elements added to semiconductors that create holes by accepting electrons, producing p-type material.  
- **Auger Recombination** — Carrier recombination process where energy is transferred to a third carrier instead of emitting light, significant at high carrier densities.  
- **Bandgap (Eg)** — The forbidden energy range between the valence band and conduction band where no electron states exist.  
- **Conduction Band (CB)** — Energy band in a semiconductor where electrons are free to move and conduct electric current.  
- **Depletion Region** — Zone around a pn-junction depleted of mobile charge carriers but containing fixed ionized dopants creating an electric field.  
- **Dopants** — Elemental impurities added to semiconductor material to change its electrical properties by increasing free carriers.  
- **Drift Current** — Carrier current caused by the motion of charge carriers under the influence of an electric field.  
- **Effective Mass** — A quantity representing the inertia of electrons or holes in a semiconductor crystal affected by its periodic potential.  
- **Einstein Relation** — Relationship between diffusion constant and mobility of carriers in a semiconductor: D/µ = kT/q.  
- **Fermi Level (Ef)** — The energy level at which the probability of finding an electron is 50%, used to describe carrier distributions at equilibrium.  
- **Fermi-Dirac Distribution** — The probability function giving the occupancy of electron energy states, accounting for quantum effects.  
- **Generation** — Process of electron-hole pair creation usually by thermal energy or light absorption in a semiconductor.  
- **Hole** — The absence of an electron in the valence band acts as a positive charge carrier.  
- **Intrinsic Carrier Concentration (ni)** — The number of free electrons or holes in a pure semiconductor at thermal equilibrium.  
- **Intrinsic Semiconductor** — Pure semiconductor material without added impurities that has equal electron and hole concentrations.  
- **Majority Carriers** — Charge carriers (electrons or holes) in a semiconductor that outnumber the opposite type due to doping.  
- **Minority Carriers** — Charge carriers less in number in a doped semiconductor, opposite in type to the majority carriers.  
- **Mobility (µ)** — Measure of how quickly charge carriers move through a semiconductor under an electric field.  
- **Poisson’s Equation** — Differential equation relating charge density to the electric potential in a semiconductor.  
- **Quasi-Fermi Levels** — Separate energy levels used to describe nonequilibrium carrier distributions in semiconductor devices.  
- **Recombination** — Process of electron and hole annihilation reducing free carriers in a semiconductor.  
- **Sheet Resistance (ρsh)** — Resistance of a thin layer of semiconductor or metal expressed in ohms per square.  
- **Shockley–Read–Hall Recombination** — Carrier recombination through deep-level traps or defects within the semiconductor bandgap.  
- **Thermal Voltage (vkT)** — The voltage equivalent of thermal energy, approximately 26 mV at room temperature.  
- **Valence Band (VB)** — The highest energy band normally filled with electrons that form chemical bonds in a semiconductor.  
- **Velocity Saturation** — Condition where carrier drift velocity reaches a maximum limit under high electric fields.

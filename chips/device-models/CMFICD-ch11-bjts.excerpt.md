This chapter presents the development of compact bipolar junction transistor (BJT) models for circuit CAD, starting from the basic Ebers–Moll (EM1) model and extending to the more accurate Spice Gummel–Poon (SGP) model, which incorporates parasitic elements, carrier recombination, base-width modulation, and high-level injection effects. The comprehensive modeling approach enhances DC and transient analysis accuracy by representing key physical phenomena such as the early effect, β-degradation, and diffusion capacitances through a set of measurable parameters and equivalent circuit representations.

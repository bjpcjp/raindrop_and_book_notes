The chapter provides a detailed theoretical foundation of the metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) capacitor system, explaining its energy band structure, operation under equilibrium and applied bias, and the formation of accumulation, depletion, and inversion regions. It develops analytical models relating surface potential, induced charge, and capacitance-voltage characteristics essential for understanding MOS device behavior and forming the basis for MOS transistor modeling.

Horn antennas, analyzed through various theoretical methods including aperture theory and GTD, provide medium-gain directional patterns with controllable polarization and are widely used as laboratory standards and reflector feeds. Design optimization involves balancing aperture dimensions, phase errors, and mode content, with specialized variants such as corrugated, ridged waveguide, and multimode horns enhancing bandwidth, pattern symmetry, and sidelobe suppression for diverse applications.

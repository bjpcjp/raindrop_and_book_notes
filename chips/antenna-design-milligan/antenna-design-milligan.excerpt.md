Modern Antenna Design by Thomas A. Milligan provides a comprehensive, practical approach to antenna theory and design, covering fundamental concepts such as antenna radiation, gain, effective area, polarization, mutual coupling, and advanced topics including array synthesis, reflector and lens antennas, and frequency-independent antennas. The text emphasizes real-world applications, measurement techniques, and the interplay between antenna parameters and system performance, making it a key resource for antenna designers and users in industry.

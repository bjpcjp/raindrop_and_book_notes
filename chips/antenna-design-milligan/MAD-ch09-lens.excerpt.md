Lens antennas use free space feed networks to excite large apertures without aperture blockage and have design advantages such as reduced tolerance requirements and high-frequency potential, while zoned lenses and dual-surface designs enable control of aperture distributions and aberration correction at the cost of bandwidth narrowing. Various lens types—including hyperboloidal, elliptical, metal plate, bootlace, and Luneburg lenses—offer different refractive properties, scanning capabilities, and bandwidth characteristics, with numerical methods facilitating practical coma-free and shaped-lens designs.

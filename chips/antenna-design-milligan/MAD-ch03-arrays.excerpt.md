The chapter discusses the principles and analysis of antenna arrays, focusing on the relationship between element spacing, phase distribution, and resulting radiation patterns, including beamforming, grating lobes, and mutual coupling effects. It presents mathematical models for linear and planar arrays, explains phenomena such as scan blindness and the impact of mutual impedance on scan impedance, and outlines methods for compensating mutual coupling to achieve desired array performance.

- **Gamma Match** — A method for feeding antennas using an unbalanced coax line, connecting the outer shield to the dipole center and tapping the center conductor to one side with series capacitive tuning.
- **Ground Plane** — A conductive surface used to provide a reference plane in antenna systems, affecting the radiation pattern and impedance; can be finite or infinite in analysis.
- **L/2 Balun (Half-Wavelength Balun)** — A balun using a half-wavelength transmission line section to achieve impedance transformation and balanced-unbalanced current cancellation.
- **Monopole** — A single conductor antenna mounted above a ground plane, equivalent to half a dipole with half the input impedance and increased gain due to hemispherical radiation.
- **Mutual Impedance** — The impedance arising from coupling between two antennas or antenna elements, affecting input impedance and radiation patterns.

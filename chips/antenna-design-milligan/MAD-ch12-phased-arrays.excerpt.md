Phased arrays steer beam direction by applying phase shifts or time-delay networks to each element, with design considerations including element spacing to prevent grating lobes, the impact of quantized phase shifters on sidelobes, and array errors affecting gain and sidelobe levels. Various feed network architectures, such as corporate and series feeds, along with array element mutual coupling and near-field measurement techniques, influence array performance, while phased arrays find applications in communication systems through diversity combining and adaptive beamforming to enhance signal reliability and capacity.

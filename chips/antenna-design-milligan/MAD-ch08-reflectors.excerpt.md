Reflector antennas, particularly paraboloidal and dual-reflector designs like Cassegrain and Gregorian, are essential for building large-aperture antennas due to their simpler feed networks and high efficiency. Key considerations in their design include understanding geometry, aperture distribution losses, phase errors, feed scanning effects, surface tolerances, blockage effects, and advanced configurations such as offset-fed, displaced-axis, and dual-reflector systems to optimize gain, reduce sidelobes, and control polarization and diffraction losses.

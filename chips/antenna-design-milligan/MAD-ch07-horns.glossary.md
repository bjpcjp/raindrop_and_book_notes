- **Amplitude Taper Loss (ATL)** — Loss in antenna gain due to non-uniform amplitude distribution across the aperture.
- **Axial Length** — Distance along the centerline from the aperture to the waveguide in a horn antenna.
- **Biconical Horn** — Antenna consisting of two cones with a common vertex, supporting TEM and higher-order modes.
- **Beamwidth** — Angular width of the main lobe of an antenna beam, commonly specified at 3 or 10 dB down from the peak.
- **Box Horn** — Horn antenna that uses multiple waveguide modes to reduce amplitude taper loss and axial length.
- **Circular-Aperture Horn** — Horn antenna with a circular aperture, supporting TE11 and TM11 modes.
- **Choke Horn** — Small-aperture horn with corrugated concentric rings in the flange to reduce cross-polarization and backlobes.
- **Corrugated Ground Plane** — Ground plane featuring corrugations designed to reduce edge diffraction and backlobes by creating artificial magnetic conductor properties.
- **Corrugated Horn** — Horn antenna with circumferential corrugations to improve polarization purity, reduce sidelobes, and equalize beamwidths.

- **Pyramidal Horn (Rectangular Horn)** — Horn antenna flaring from a rectangular waveguide with flat metallic walls, supporting TE10 mode.
- **Quadratic Phase Distribution Constant (S)** — Dimensionless constant characterizing the quadratic phase error across a horn aperture.
- **Ridged Waveguide Horn** — Horn antenna fed by a waveguide with ridges that lower cutoff frequency and extend bandwidth.
- **Scalar Horn** — Corrugated horn with a wide half-flare angle, designed for wide beamwidth and fixed phase-center at the apex.
- **Slant Radius (R)** — Distance from the junction of the projected sides of a horn flare to the aperture plane along the flare surface.
- **T-bar-fed Slot Antenna** — Cavity-backed slot antenna fed by a T-shaped probe to achieve broadband impedance matching.
- **TE10 Mode** — Lowest order rectangular waveguide mode with a cosine electric field distribution across the width.
- **TE11 Mode** — Dominant mode in circular waveguides characterized by an azimuthal electric field distribution.
- **TM11 Mode** — Transverse magnetic mode in circular waveguides, used to shape mode patterns in stepped or multimode horns.

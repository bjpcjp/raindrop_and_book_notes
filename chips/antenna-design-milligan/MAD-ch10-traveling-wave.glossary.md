- **Amplitude taper efficiency** — Reduction in gain due to nonuniform amplitude distribution along an antenna aperture.

- **Beamwidth** — The angular width of the main radiation lobe, usually measured between half-power (–3 dB) points.

- **Beverage antenna** — A traveling-wave antenna consisting of a long wire close to the ground, fed relative to ground, with directional properties controlled by length.

- **Circumference (C)** — The perimeter of a helical antenna turn; affects axial mode operation and relative propagation constant.

- **Cross-polarization** — Radiation component orthogonal to the intended polarization, often undesirable.

- **Directivity** — The measure of antenna gain relative to an isotropic radiator, depending primarily on antenna length and propagation constant in traveling-wave antennas.

- **Dipole null** — A null in the radiation pattern at broadside direction due to the dipole element pattern.

- **End-fire antenna** — Antenna radiating energy primarily along the axis of structure, toward the end.

- **Fast wave (Leaky wave)** — Wave with relative propagation constant P < 1, radiating energy away from the guiding structure progressively along its length.

- **Field attenuation constant (α)** — The exponential attenuation of fields normal to a surface or structure.

- **Gain bandwidth product** — The trade-off metric between the antenna's gain and the frequency bandwidth over which gain is maintained.

- **Hansen and Woodyard criterion** — A design rule prescribing phase constant P to achieve maximum directivity in traveling-wave antennas.

- **Helical antenna (axial mode)** — A traveling-wave antenna in which a wire helix with circumference near λ produces circularly polarized end-fire radiation.

- **Leaky wave antenna** — Antenna working on fast waves that leak power from the structure through slots or irregularities.

- **Long wire antenna** — A traveling-wave antenna consisting of a long, terminated wire with current traveling predominantly in one direction.

- **Loop antenna (resonant loop / cubic quad)** — Antenna element resonant near a full wavelength with radiation maximum normal to the loop plane and often used in Yagi–Uda arrays.

- **Mutual impedance** — The coupling impedance between antenna elements influencing currents and radiation patterns.

- **Phase propagation constant (P)** — The relative propagation constant differing from free space, indicating wave speed and guiding properties; P > 1 slow waves, P < 1 leaky waves.

- **Rhombic antenna** — A traveling-wave antenna constructed from two V antennas connected to provide directional gain with a single terminating resistor.

- **Slow wave** — Wave on a surface or transmission line with P > 1, bound to the surface with exponential decay normal to it and radiating from discontinuities.

- **Slotline** — A narrow slot in a conductive plane used as a transmission line and radiation structure in tapered slot antennas.

- **Tapered slot antenna (Vivaldi antenna)** — End-fire antenna constructed from a flared slot etched on a dielectric substrate producing wide bandwidth and directional radiation.

- **Termination resistance** — Load applied to the end of a traveling-wave antenna to absorb power, minimizing reflections.

- **Traveling-wave antenna** — An antenna formed from a structure on which a wave travels predominantly unidirectionally, radiating energy progressively.

- **Wave propagation modes (T0, T1, T2)** — Modes of wave propagation on a helical wire; T1 mode produces axial mode radiation with beam along the helix axis.

- **Wave attenuation (leakage α)** — Rate at which power leaks from leaky-wave structures, limiting effective antenna length.

- **Wire diameter effect** — Increasing conductor diameter decreases beamwidth and increases gain slightly in traveling-wave antennas.

- **Yagi–Uda antenna** — A parasitic array antenna using driven and parasitic elements arranged to produce a traveling-wave end-fire beam.

- **Zucker's amplitude distribution** — A surface-wave amplitude distribution with 3 dB peak near the input tapered for antenna gain adjustment.

The chapter discusses various antenna analysis methods, emphasizing the balance between computational effort and practical design constraints, and introduces techniques like physical optics (PO), geometric optics (GO), and numerical methods such as the method of moments (MOM) and finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) for analyzing and optimizing antenna radiation patterns and interactions with structures. It highlights the use of vector potentials, equivalent currents, boundary conditions, and ray-based theories (GTD/UTD) to calculate fields, including diffraction effects and iterative induced currents, while considering trade-offs in accuracy, efficiency, and applicability to different antenna sizes and environments.

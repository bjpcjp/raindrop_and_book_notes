This chapter discusses aperture distributions and array synthesis techniques, focusing on designing antenna arrays with controlled amplitude taper and phase error efficiencies to optimize directivity and sidelobe levels. Various methods, including Taylor, Dolph-Chebyshev, Bayliss, Woodward, Schelkunoffâ€™s unit-circle, Villeneuve, and Orchard synthesis are presented to manipulate aperture or array pattern nulls and zeros for achieving desired radiation patterns, sidelobe suppression, and shaped beams.

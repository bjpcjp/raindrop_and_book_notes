- **Aperture Feed** — Exciting a microstrip patch antenna through a slot (aperture) in the ground plane, coupling power from a transmission line located beneath the patch to the radiating element.

- **Bandwidth** — The range of frequencies over which an antenna maintains acceptable performance, often defined by a 2:1 VSWR or specific axial ratio criteria.

- **Cavity Antenna** — An antenna conceptualized as a resonant cavity formed between the patch metallization and the ground plane, with radiating edges acting as open circuit boundaries.

- **Circular Polarization** — Polarization in which the electric field rotates circularly with time; achieved in microstrip patches by feeding two orthogonal modes 90° out of phase or by perturbing patch geometry to create two orthogonal modes with proper phase difference.

- **Compact Patch Antenna** — A microstrip patch antenna designed to reduce physical size by extending current paths through techniques like shorting pins, folds, or notches, often at the expense of increased input reactance.

- **Crossed-Slot Feed** — A feed structure employing orthogonal slots in the ground plane to feed dual polarization or circular polarization patches, enhancing isolation and reducing cross-polarization.

- **Directly Fed Stacked Patch** — A multi-layer microstrip antenna configuration in which the lower patch is directly fed by a coaxial probe and electromagnetically couples to an upper patch to increase bandwidth.

- **Effective Dielectric Constant (εeff)** — An approximate parameter used to characterize the propagation velocity in microstrip structures accounting for both substrate dielectric and fringing fields.

- **Feed Probe Inductance** — The inductive reactance introduced by a coaxial probe feed passing through the substrate, affecting impedance and necessitating matching elements like series capacitors.

- **Fringing Fields** — Electromagnetic fields extending beyond the physical edges of the patch, contributing to radiation and effective size extension of the patch.

- **Impedance Bandwidth** — The frequency range over which the antenna input impedance matches the desired system impedance within acceptable VSWR limits.

- **Insertion Loss** — Power loss due to coupling inefficiencies or feed network losses and unwanted radiation from feed structures.

- **Magnetic Currents** — Equivalent magnetic currents placed along the edges of a microstrip patch to simplify and analyze the radiation pattern and fields of the antenna.

- **Microstrip Dipole** — A narrow microstrip patch fed by a coupled microstrip line beneath it, allowing impedance transformation and practical feed implementations.

- **Patch Radiation Conductance** — The conductance component of the admittance looking into the radiating edges of the patch, representing power radiated per volt squared.

- **Phase Shift (δ) in Series-Fed Arrays** — The excess phase added by connection steps or discontinuities at patch junctions affecting array scanning and impedance.

- **Planar Inverted F Antenna (PIFA)** — A compact patch variant with a shorting plate or pin, fed near the short, used for reduced size and robust performance in handset applications.

- **Quality Factor (Q)** — A measure of antenna sharpness of resonance related to the ratio of stored to radiated (and dissipated) energy, inversely related to bandwidth.

- **Reactive Power Divider** — A microstrip distribution element providing equal amplitude and phase outputs with limited isolation and matched input, used to feed arrays.

- **Resonant Length** — The effective electrical length of the patch that supports resonance; extended beyond physical length due to fringing fields.

- **Series-Fed Array** — A linear microstrip array where patches are connected in series by transmission lines spaced at half-wavelength intervals, allowing impedance additivity.

- **Shorting Pin** — A vertical conductor connecting patch metallization to the ground plane to create a virtual short circuit, used to reduce resonant size or stabilize grounding.

- **Slot Aperture Coupling** — Feeding a microstrip patch through an aperture etched in the ground plane, enabling multi-layer antenna designs and bandwidth improvement.

- **Surface Waves** — Guided waves bound to the dielectric substrate, excited by the patch, reducing radiation efficiency and causing coupling between elements.

- **Transmission-Line Model** — A simplified representation treating a microstrip patch as a transmission line with radiation and susceptance loading at edges.

- **Two-Element Slot Array** — An equivalent radiating structure modeling the patch radiation as two magnetic current slots spaced approximately half a wavelength apart.

- **VSWR (Voltage Standing Wave Ratio)** — A measure of impedance matching; used to define acceptable antenna impedance bandwidth.

- **Wideband Aperture-Coupled Antenna** — A multi-resonator antenna formed by stacking patches with aperture coupling to increase bandwidth beyond single-element limits.

This chapter discusses the principles, designs, and feeding methods of dipoles, slots, loops, and related antenna structures, emphasizing standing-wave current distributions, radiation resistance, and the Babinet–Booker principle linking dipoles and slots. It also covers practical configurations such as dipoles over ground planes, balun designs to ensure proper feeding and balance, multifaceted antennas like turnstiles and quadriﬁlar helices for circular polarization, and specialized antennas including sleeve monopoles, cavity-mounted dipoles, and super turnstile (batwing) antennas, highlighting their impedance and radiation characteristics.

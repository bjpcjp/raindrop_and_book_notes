Antennas radiate electromagnetic waves from currents and are characterized by properties such as gain, directivity, effective area, polarization, and noise temperature, which influence their performance in transmitting and receiving signals over various propagation conditions. Understanding these properties, along with factors like impedance mismatch, mutual coupling, and environmental effects, is essential for designing efficient communication and radar systems.

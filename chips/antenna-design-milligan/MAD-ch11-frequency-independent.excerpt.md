Frequency-independent antennas achieve wideband performance by incorporating self-scaling structures, such as spirals and log-periodic designs, whose active regions scale with wavelength to maintain consistent radiation characteristics. Spiral antennas, including equiangular and conical variants, radiate circular polarization from finite active regions and require specialized feeding techniques and careful truncation to suppress unwanted modes, while log-periodic antennas use discrete logarithmic scaling of elements to cover broad frequency ranges, with applications as broad bandwidth feeds for paraboloidal reflectors.

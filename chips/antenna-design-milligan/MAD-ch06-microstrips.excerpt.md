Microstrip antennas, consisting of metal patches on dielectric substrates backed by a ground plane, operate as planar resonant cavities that radiate from their edges and are widely used for their low cost, low profile, and mechanical robustness. Various design techniques, including feeding methods, patch shape modifications, stacking, and aperture coupling, are employed to enhance impedance bandwidth, control radiation patterns, and achieve polarization properties, while managing limitations such as surface-wave losses and bandwidth constraints inherent in their resonant nature.

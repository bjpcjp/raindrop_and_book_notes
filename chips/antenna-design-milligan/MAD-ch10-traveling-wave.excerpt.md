Traveling-wave antennas utilize transmission-line structures where wave propagation along the structure, characterized by length and relative propagation constant, determines key properties such as gain, bandwidth, and beam direction. Various designs—including line antennas like Beverage and rhombic antennas, planar arrays such as Yagi-Uda dipoles, and specialized configurations like helical, corrugated rod, dielectric rod, and tapered slot antennas—achieve end-fire or scanning radiation patterns by controlling wave binding, leakage, and phase distribution along their length.

This chapter discusses layout techniques to minimize parasitic inductances in GaN transistor circuits, focusing on the critical common-source inductance, power loop inductance, and gate loop inductance to optimize high-frequency performance. Various approaches for single devices, half-bridge configurations, and paralleling multiple transistors are presented, highlighting methods such as magnetic field self-cancellation, symmetrical layouts, and interleaved vias to reduce inductance and improve efficiency.

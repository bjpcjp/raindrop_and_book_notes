1. **Q:** Explain the primary components of hard-switching power losses in GaN transistors and how these components are quantitatively modeled to calculate total dynamic losses.
   **A:** Hard-switching power losses in GaN transistors comprise switching losses during voltage (QGD) and current (QGS2) transitions, output capacitance losses (POSS), gate charge losses (PG), reverse conduction losses (PSD), and reverse recovery losses (PRR). Switching losses (Psw) are derived from Miller charge (QGD) and gate charge (QGS2) using gate driver voltage and resistance in Equations 6.11–6.13. POSS losses relate to charging/discharging device output capacitance (COSS) per Equation 6.14, gate losses depend on total gate charge (QG) and driver voltage per Equation 6.15, reverse conduction arises from diode conduction in dead-time intervals per Equation 6.16, and reverse recovery is negligible for enhancement-mode GaN devices but considered for MOSFET/cascode devices per Equation 6.21. Total dynamic loss PDYN sums these components as per Equation 6.22.

2. **Q:** How does common-source inductance (CSI) affect gate drive performance and switching losses in hard-switching converters using GaN transistors, and how can this influence be quantified?
   **A:** CSI induces a voltage opposing the gate voltage during current transitions, effectively increasing the gate circuit resistance and lengthening the current rise time (tCR_CSI). This delays switching transitions and raises dynamic losses, particularly during the QGS2 current transition interval. Equation 6.31 quantifies CSI’s equivalent resistance as RCSI = LS * gm / CGS, showing GaN transistors with lower CGS have a higher sensitivity to CSI. The incorporation of RCSI into switching loss calculations (Equations 6.63 and 6.64) significantly increases predicted losses, confirmed experimentally and through simulations (e.g., a 2 Ω resistance rise for 100 pH CSI in MOSFETs becomes ~7 Ω in GaN devices).

3. **Q:** What is the hard-switching figure of merit (FOMHS), how is it defined, and what insight does it provide when comparing GaN transistors to silicon MOSFETs?
   **A:** FOMHS quantifies device performance regarding hard-switching losses by combining gate charge components (QGD + QGS2) and conduction losses (RDS(on)) per Equation 6.23: FOMHS = (QGD + QGS2) * RDS(on). Lower FOMHS values indicate lower total losses and better efficiency potential. Figure 6.8 shows 200 V GaN transistors have FOMHS comparable to 40 V Si MOSFETs, and 600 V GaN transistors align with 100 V MOSFETs, evidencing GaN’s superior switching and conduction characteristics that enable higher frequency, more efficient power conversion.

4. **Q:** Describe the role and calculation of effective dead-time in hard-switching converters and its impact on reverse conduction losses and zero-voltage switching (ZVS) transitions.
   **A:** Effective dead-time (teff) is the interval between one device turning off and the other turning on, defined as the time from gate voltage of one device reaching turn-off plateau to the load current commutating from diode conduction. Its length determines whether the converter operates in full ZVS, partial ZVS, or diode conduction mode. The zero-voltage switching interval (tZVS) is calculated from output charge QOSS and current Iturn-off (Equation 6.18). Reverse conduction time (tSD) = teff – tZVS (Equation 6.19) defines diode conduction losses (PSD) per Equation 6.16 if positive. A negative tSD indicates partial ZVS where voltage switching occurs below bus voltage, diminishing losses but requiring careful control. Effective dead-time strongly influences efficiency due to its direct effect on conduction losses.

5. **Q:** How does switching frequency influence transformer and inductor losses in hard-switching converters employing GaN transistors, including material-dependent considerations?
   **A:** Increasing switching frequency reduces magnetic component size but non-linearly affects losses. For transformers, maintaining constant flux density at higher frequencies allows reduction in core cross-sectional area to ~60%, lowering core volume and copper losses despite possible increased core loss per volume (Figure 6.20). In inductors, DC current components reduce flux and core loss impact relative to transformers. However, skin effect increases AC winding resistance with frequency, slightly raising conduction losses. Material selection is critical: some soft magnetic materials perform better at elevated frequencies; beyond multi-MHz, core materials may limit frequency benefits, pushing designs toward alternative materials or air-core inductors.

6. **Q:** In the provided buck converter example, how are switching and conduction losses analytically determined for both control and synchronous rectifier GaN transistors, and how do these calculations compare with experimental efficiency measurements?
   **A:** The buck converter’s duty cycle determines inductor ripple current and currents at turn-on/turn-off (Equations 6.33–6.35). Switching losses (Pon, Poff) are calculated separately for control and synchronous switches using Equations 6.11 and 6.12 with parameters QGD, QGS2, gate resistance, and IDS, including the output capacitance charge (Equation 6.14) losses assigned to the control switch. Diode conduction losses (PSD) from effective dead-time and conduction voltage are computed per Equation 6.16 for the synchronous rectifier. Gate charge losses are derived from QG and switching frequency (Equation 6.15). Conduction losses use RMS current and RDS(on) (Equations 6.54–6.55). Total calculated loss aligns closely (~88.9% efficiency) with measured efficiency (~88.1%) including corrections for common-source inductance and controller power, validating the analysis.

7. **Q:** What strategies are discussed to mitigate body diode conduction losses in enhancement-mode GaN transistor-based converters, and what trade-offs do these methods entail?
   **A:** Body diode conduction losses (PSD) are higher in enhancement-mode GaN transistors due to higher forward drop compared to MOSFET body diodes (Figure 6.16). The addition of an anti-parallel Schottky diode reduces conduction voltage during diode conduction periods, minimizing losses and reducing reliance on precise dead-time control (Figure 6.18). However, incorporating a Schottky diode adds output capacitance, increasing COSS-related losses slightly. The critical requirement is minimizing parasitic inductance among the GaN device and diode to preserve switching performance. Experimental results demonstrate efficiency improvement at various effective dead-times with Schottky diode inclusion (Figure 6.19).
   **External example:** APEC 2017 paper details how adding external Schottky diodes reduces conduction losses in GaN-based synchronous rectifiers: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7931458

8. **Q:** How do high-frequency power loop inductance and PCB layout influence hard-switching losses and voltage overshoot in GaN transistor-based converters?
   **A:** High-frequency power loop inductance (LLoop) slows voltage and current commutation, increases voltage overshoot during switch turn-off, and slightly reduces voltage during turn-on. While turn-on gains partial loss reduction, the net effect of LLoop increases total switching loss (Figure 6.13). PCB layout optimization minimizes LLoop, directly enhancing efficiency and reducing EMI. Empirical data (Figure 6.14) shows efficiency degradation (>4%) when LLoop increases from 0.4 nH to 2.9 nH. Waveforms (Figure 6.15) exemplify decreased voltage overshoot with lower LLoop, improving device reliability and system performance.

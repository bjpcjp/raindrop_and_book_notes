GaN transistors, particularly enhancement-mode HEMTs, offer significant advantages over silicon MOSFETs for power conversion with superior electrical characteristics such as lower on-resistance, higher breakdown voltage, and negligible reverse recovery charge due to their unique two-dimensional electron gas structure and wide bandgap material properties. Despite challenges in device design, packaging, and gate driving, GaN technology enables smaller, more efficient, and cost-effective power conversion systems with improved thermal stability and switching performance.

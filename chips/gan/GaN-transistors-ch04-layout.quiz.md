1. **Q:** What are the three main parasitic inductances critical to GaN transistor circuit performance, and how should they be prioritized in layout minimization efforts?
   **A:** The three main parasitic inductances are common-source inductance (CSI), high-frequency power loop inductance, and gate loop inductance. They should be minimized in order of importance: first CSI, then power loop inductance, and lastly gate loop inductance, because CSI critically impacts switching performance.
   **External example:** The importance of minimizing CSI in GaN device layout is discussed in a Texas Instruments application report on GaN driver layout: https://www.ti.com/lit/an/slyt819/slyt819.pdf.

2. **Q:** How does the layout strategy differ between high-voltage PQFN GaN device packages and wafer level chip-scale packages (WLCSP) with land grid array (LGA) terminals in terms of common-source inductance minimization?
   **A:** For high-voltage PQFN packages with separate gate-return source pins, gate drive and power loops are separated within the package to reduce CSI, avoiding external connection of these separately. For WLCSP LGA devices without separate pins, the source pads closest to the gate are designated as the “star” connection point for both gate and power loops, with gate and power currents directed in opposite or orthogonal directions to minimize CSI externally.

3. **Q:** Explain the principle of magnetic field self-cancellation in PCB layout of GaN power loops and its practical implementation in multilayer PCBs.
   **A:** Magnetic field self-cancellation reduces loop inductance by arranging equal and opposing currents in adjacent conductor layers, thereby canceling magnetic fields generated by each current. This is implemented by designing parallel plate-like transmission lines with the return path directly adjacent under the power loop, using wide conductors and minimizing spacing to reduce area (h × l) of the loop. Interleaved vias with alternating current directions on multilayer PCBs further enhance this effect.

4. **Q:** Compare and contrast the lateral, vertical, and optimal power loop PCB layout approaches for LGA GaN transistor-based converters, including their advantages and drawbacks.
   **A:** 
   - Lateral loop: Input capacitors and devices placed on the same PCB side; small loop size, shield layer reduces inductance; inductance largely independent of board thickness; single-sided PCB capable.
   - Vertical loop: Capacitors placed under devices; loop formed vertically through PCB vias; no shield layer; relies on magnetic field self-cancellation between top/bottom layers; inductance dependent on board thickness; not single-sided PCB capable.
   - Optimal loop: Combines small loop size with magnetic field self-cancellation by using the first inner layer as return path directly beneath top layer; inductance independent of board thickness; no shield layer; single-sided PCB capable.
   **External example:** Texas Instruments discusses vertical and planar layouts for GaN power stages highlighting similar trade-offs: https://www.ti.com/lit/an/slyy165/slyy165.pdf.

5. **Q:** What are the key layout considerations and methods to ensure effective paralleling of multiple GaN transistors in a single switching element for high-speed operation?
   **A:** Key considerations include ensuring complete symmetry of power loops, common-source inductances, and gate loop inductances to balance current sharing and minimize CSI mismatches. This requires diagonal interconnected drains and sources for resistance matching, separate gate resistors for independent speed control, gate-return source planes isolated on inner PCB layers, and use of interleaved vias with opposing current flows to minimize inductances. GaN’s positive temperature coefficient aids current sharing by negative feedback.
   **External example:** EPC application notes on paralleling GaN FETs emphasize symmetrical layout importance and current sharing: https://epc-co.com/epc/DesignSupport/ApplicationNotes.aspx.

6. **Q:** Describe the layout strategy for paralleling complete half-bridge power loops compared to paralleling individual GaN devices, including the rationale behind it.
   **A:** Paralleling entire half-bridge power loops rather than individual devices achieves better symmetry for gate drivers and power loops, avoids CSI mismatches inherent to asymmetrical individual device paralleling, and results in high-frequency currents confined within each loop. Although it increases low-frequency loop inductance between DC supply terminals, these carry no high-frequency currents and thus do not impact switching performance.
   **External example:** Analog Devices' white paper on GaN half-bridge designs recommends paralleling half-bridge loops to optimize switching performance: https://www.analog.com/en/technical-articles/high-performance-gallium-nitride-half-bridge-power-stage.html.

7. **Q:** What role do interleaved vias play in reducing inductance and power losses in GaN transistor PCB layouts?
   **A:** Interleaved vias carry current in opposing directions, which creates magnetic field self-cancellation reducing loop inductance and stored magnetic energy. This minimizes eddy and proximity effects, reducing AC conduction losses. They also provide shorter current paths, lowering resistance and conduction losses, especially during transistor freewheeling periods.
   **External example:** Texas Instruments’ application guide on power stage layout highlights interleaved vias as a technique to reduce inductance and AC losses: https://www.ti.com/lit/an/slua618/slua618.pdf.

8. **Q:** How does GaN transistor temperature coefficient characteristics favor paralleling compared to Si MOSFETs for high-speed switching applications?
   **A:** GaN transistors have a positive temperature coefficient across the entire gate voltage range, causing increased device temperature to raise on-resistance and plateau voltage, thereby reducing current flow and promoting natural current sharing. In contrast, MOSFETs exhibit a negative threshold voltage temperature coefficient, which can increase current in hotter devices, leading to current imbalance and potential thermal runaway with paralleling.
   **External example:** A review on GaN transistor temperature effects confirms positive temperature coefficient benefits for paralleling: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6700317.

9. **Q:** Summarize the main PCB layering and current flow arrangements recommended for minimizing inductances in a four-parallel device GaN half-bridge layout.
   **A:** The layout uses a multilayer PCB where:  
   - Top layer places devices in mirrored optimal arrangements with gate resistors.  
   - Second layer forms isolated gate-return source planes with separate grounds for high and low sides, minimizing CSI and gate loop inductance and allowing symmetrical gate drives.  
   - Third layer buses gate drive signals and forms the switch node, with opposing currents in power loop drain and gate layers enabling magnetic field cancellation.  
   - Bottom layer handles low-side returns and DC bus connections, adjacent to power and gate layers for further field cancellation and reduced inductance.
   **External example:** TI’s GaN EVM documentation presents similar multilayer stacking for half-bridge layouts: https://www.ti.com/lit/ug/slua759/slua759.pdf.

10. **Q:** Why is minimizing board thickness particularly important for vertical power loop designs in GaN transistor circuits?
    **A:** In vertical power loops, the loop area (and thus inductance) includes the vertical distance (board thickness) between top and bottom layers carrying opposing currents. Decreasing board thickness compresses loop area, thereby improving magnetic field self-cancellation effectiveness and reducing overall loop inductance. Thicker boards increase loop area and limit this self-cancellation benefit.
    **External example:** An application note from Infineon on vertical loop layouts explains board thickness’s impact on loop inductance: https://www.infineon.com/dgdl/Infineon-ApplicationNote-Design_Considerations_for_GaN_PCs-AN-v01_01-EN.pdf?fileId=5546d462533600a40153569502b71adf.

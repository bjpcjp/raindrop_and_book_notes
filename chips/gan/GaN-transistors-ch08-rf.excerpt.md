This chapter presents the RF performance characteristics and amplifier design methodology for enhancement-mode GaN transistors, highlighting their superior RF power gain, linearity, and drain efficiency compared to LDMOS FETs. An example using the EPC8009 eGaN FET demonstrates that despite being designed for switching applications, GaN transistors offer excellent stable gain, wide bandwidth, and high efficiency, making them well-suited for advanced RF applications.

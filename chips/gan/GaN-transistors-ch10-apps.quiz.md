1. **Q:** How do GaN transistors improve performance in non-isolated, point-of-load (POL) DC-DC converters compared to silicon MOSFETs, specifically regarding switching frequency and efficiency?
   **A:** GaN transistors enable operation at frequencies well above the 200 kHz to 1 MHz range typical for silicon MOSFETs without efficiency loss due to their lower switching losses and superior figures of merit (FOM). This allows higher switching frequencies, leading to reduced passive component sizes, faster transient responses, and overall higher power density and efficiency in POL converters.

2. **Q:** What are the effects of PCB layout and loop inductance on GaN transistor performance in high-frequency buck converters, and how does the optimal power loop design mitigate these effects?
   **A:** Loop inductance significantly influences voltage overshoot, switching speed (dv/dt), and power loss. Lateral power loops have higher inductance than vertical loops; the optimal power loop combines the benefits of both, minimizing loop inductance by eliminating shield layers and reducing loop size. This yields lower voltage overshoot, higher switching speed (up to 500% increase over conventional layouts), reduced power loss, and improved full-load efficiency by up to 3.5%.

3. **Q:** Describe the challenges and design considerations in paralleling high-speed GaN transistors for high-current buck converters, and summarize how PCB layout affects current sharing and thermal performance.
   **A:** Critical parasitic elements like common source inductance and high-frequency loop inductance must be minimized and balanced among parallel devices to ensure equal dynamic current sharing and prevent electrical and thermal imbalances. PCB layouts with distributed high-frequency power loops balance parasitics better than single loop layouts, leading to improved current sharing, reduced hot spots (thermal imbalance), increased efficiency (up to 0.2%), and up to 10 °C lower maximum transistor temperatures.

4. **Q:** In isolated DC-DC intermediate bus converters (IBCs), how do GaN transistors improve power density and efficiency compared to silicon MOSFET designs, and what impact does this have on design choices such as switching frequency and transformer size?
   **A:** GaN transistors enable higher switching frequencies (e.g., 33% higher) due to their lower switching losses and absence of reverse recovery charge, allowing for smaller, lighter transformers and inductors and increased output power (e.g., 15% more output power for same losses in an eighth-brick converter). This results in higher power density and efficiency, overcoming thermal design limits and size constraints faced by Si MOSFET-based designs.

5. **Q:** Explain the role of GaN transistors in Class-D audio amplifiers, focusing on total harmonic distortion (THD), damping factor (DF), and efficiency improvements over silicon MOSFETs.
   **A:** GaN transistors allow significantly reduced dead-time (down to ~5 ns) due to faster switching and zero reverse recovery, which decreases crossover distortion and therefore lowers open-loop THD. Lower on-resistance devices improve damping factor by reducing output impedance, minimizing voltage variation under load changes, and improving audio fidelity. The resulting Class-D amplifiers achieve higher efficiency (~96% at 150W into 8 Ω) and improved sonic quality without bulky heatsinks.

6. **Q:** What are the main benefits of GaN transistors in envelope tracking (ET) power supplies for RF power amplifiers, and how do they address the challenges of high bandwidth envelope signals?
   **A:** GaN transistors offer lower capacitances and improved figures of merit enabling high-frequency (up to 10 MHz) high-efficiency buck converters critical for ET supplies. Their low gate charge and output capacitance reduce gate drive losses and allow faster switching speeds (e.g., 75 V/ns slew rates), while minimizing power loss despite the wide modulation bandwidth (e.g., 20 MHz for 4G LTE). GaN devices also allow smaller device sizes with higher RDS(on), optimizing efficiency and reducing thermal dissipation in ET modulators.

7. **Q:** In wireless energy transfer systems operating in the 6.78 MHz ISM band, how do GaN transistors enhance performance in ZVS voltage-mode Class-D and single-ended Class-E amplifiers?
   **A:** GaN transistors reduce gate drive power losses due to lower gate charge and faster switching, enabling higher operating frequencies and improved efficiency (83-84% at ~30 W load). In ZVS VMCD, they facilitate bootstrap supply operation at higher frequencies and maintain robust zero-voltage switching despite load variations. In single-ended Class-E, they maintain low device losses across load changes due to suitable soft-switching FOMs. Thermal measurements show lower device temperature with GaN transistors, eliminating the need for heatsinking.

8. **Q:** Compare GaN transistors to Si MOSFETs regarding their figures of merit (FOM) in power factor correction (PFC) applications and explain how GaN devices enable improved PFC performance, especially in bridgeless totem pole topologies.
   **A:** GaN transistors exhibit over seven times lower gate charge times RDS(on) and nearly eight times lower combined gate charge plus output charge FOM than Si MOSFETs, directly reducing switching and gate drive losses. They have zero reverse recovery charge, eliminating diode-related losses that limit bridgeless totem pole PFC operation in MOSFETs. This enables GaN-based PFC converters to achieve higher efficiency (e.g., >98.5% at 50 kHz) and reduce total power loss significantly compared to Si MOSFET equivalents.

9. **Q:** How do GaN transistors compare with silicon IGBTs and MOSFETs in motor drive and photovoltaic inverter applications, in terms of switching frequency and efficiency?
   **A:** GaN transistors enable switching frequencies 3–6 times higher than IGBTs and MOSFETs (e.g., 100 kHz vs. 16 kHz in PV inverter and 100 kHz vs. 15 kHz in motor drive) while providing comparable or better efficiency (e.g., 2% increase in motor drives). Higher switching frequencies allow significant reductions in converter volume, improved transient response, and system integration, as exemplified by a 45% volume reduction in a 4 kW PV inverter using GaN devices.

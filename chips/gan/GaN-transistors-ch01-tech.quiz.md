1. **Q:** Explain the fundamental differences in physical properties among Silicon, GaN, and SiC that impact their suitability for power transistor applications, and how these differences translate to device performance such as on-resistance and breakdown voltage.  
   **A:** Silicon, GaN, and SiC differ primarily in band gap, critical electric field, electron mobility, permittivity, and thermal conductivity. GaN and SiC have much wider band gaps (3.39 eV and 3.26 eV vs. 1.12 eV for silicon) and significantly higher critical fields (3.3 MV/cm and 2.2 MV/cm vs. 0.23 MV/cm), allowing for thinner drift regions and higher breakdown voltages. Electron mobility is similar or slightly lower in SiC (950 cm²/V·s) compared to silicon (1400 cm²/V·s) but highest in GaN (~1500 cm²/V·s). These properties mean GaN and SiC devices can achieve much lower on-resistance and smaller sizes for the same blocking voltage compared to silicon, enabling superior conduction efficiency and voltage handling. The fundamental relationship derived from equations 1.1 to 1.4 shows on-resistance scales inversely with the cube of the critical field, making GaN and SiC able to outperform silicon in power device applications.

2. **Q:** Describe the formation and significance of the two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) in GaN/AlGaN heterostructures and its role in GaN HEMT performance.  
   **A:** The 2DEG forms at the interface of the AlGaN/GaN heterostructure due to strain-induced piezoelectric polarization in the wurtzite crystal structure, generating a high-density sheet of electrons confined in a narrow region with very high mobility (~1500–2000 cm²/V·s). This confinement reduces scattering and increases electron mobility compared to unstrained GaN. The 2DEG provides a highly conductive channel that enables high-speed electron transport, which is the basis of the GaN high electron mobility transistor (HEMT) enabling improved switching speed, lower on-resistance, and better power conversion performance than silicon MOSFETs.  
   **External example:** The role of 2DEG in AlGaN/GaN HEMTs and their high electron mobility is discussed in a peer-reviewed article analyzing device physics: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6136898

3. **Q:** Compare and contrast the four enhancement-mode GaN transistor structures (recessed gate, implanted gate, pGaN gate, and cascode hybrid) including their operating principles and typical applications.  
   **A:**  
   - Recessed gate: Thins the AlGaN barrier to reduce piezoelectric polarization, depleting the 2DEG at zero gate bias, requiring positive gate voltage to conduct.  
   - Implanted gate: Uses fluorine ion implantation into AlGaN to trap negative charge, depleting the 2DEG and enabling enhancement-mode behavior.  
   - pGaN gate: Grows a p-type GaN layer atop AlGaN to induce positive charge that depletes the 2DEG at zero bias; positive gate voltage reestablishes conduction.  
   - Cascode hybrid: Connects a low-voltage enhancement-mode silicon MOSFET in series with a depletion-mode GaN HEMT, achieving enhancement-mode operation without modifying GaN epitaxy.  
   The pGaN gate is commercially prevalent due to stability and performance; recessed and implanted gates require more complex processing; cascode devices are used mainly for higher voltage (>200 V) due to added resistance from the silicon MOSFET.

4. **Q:** Explain why GaN transistors grown on silicon substrates have become a commercially viable platform for power conversion applications despite lattice mismatch and thermal expansion coefficient differences.  
   **A:** GaN on silicon substrates is attractive due to the low cost and mature silicon fabrication infrastructure. Although silicon has a large lattice mismatch (17%) and differing thermal expansion compared to GaN, buffer layers such as AlN seed and AlGaN buffer layers are used to accommodate strain and improve crystal quality. This heteroepitaxy process allows the formation of high-quality GaN devices at lower cost than silicon carbide substrates, making GaN on silicon suitable for cost-sensitive applications like DC-DC converters and AC-DC power supplies while still delivering the superior electrical performance of GaN HEMTs.

5. **Q:** Discuss the implications of wire bonding versus direct solder attachment for electrical connections in GaN transistor packages, particularly in relation to the device’s switching performance and reliability.  
   **A:** GaN transistors support very high switching speeds, making them sensitive to parasitic inductances. Wire bonds introduce significant inductance and potential mechanical reliability issues, which can limit switching performance and increase power losses or ringing in circuits. Direct solder attachment of solder bars to the GaN transistor’s metal pads reduces inductance and improves thermal conduction and mechanical robustness. This soldering technique enables GaN devices to realize their high-speed switching potential and improved reliability, especially important for high-frequency power conversion applications.

6. **Q:** How does the critical electric field (Ecrit) of a semiconductor material influence the design and efficiency of power transistors, and why are GaN and SiC devices able to achieve thinner drift regions than silicon for the same breakdown voltage?  
   **A:** The critical electric field defines the maximum electric field a semiconductor can sustain before avalanche breakdown. Higher Ecrit means the device can sustain higher voltages in a thinner drift region (wdrift). GaN and SiC have critical fields roughly 10 times higher than silicon, allowing drift regions that are about 10 times thinner for the same breakdown voltage. Thinner drift regions reduce on-resistance and device size, enhancing conduction efficiency and switching speed. Thus, GaN and SiC devices can be designed smaller and more efficient than silicon devices for equivalent voltage ratings.

7. **Q:** What are the advantages and disadvantages of depletion-mode GaN HEMTs versus enhancement-mode GaN HEMTs in power electronics, especially regarding gate drive requirements and circuit design?  
   **A:** Depletion-mode (d-mode) GaN HEMTs are normally on, conducting at zero gate bias and requiring a negative gate voltage to turn off, complicating startup circuits and gate driver design. Enhancement-mode (e-mode) GaN HEMTs are normally off, conducting only when positive gate voltage is applied, thus compatible with existing silicon MOSFET gate drivers and safer at startup. However, e-mode devices require additional processing (recessed, implanted, or pGaN gate) and are more complex to fabricate. D-mode devices are simpler but less convenient in practical power converter designs due to the need for negative gate bias to prevent short circuits.  
   **External example:** Review articles in power electronics underline the enhanced ease of use and compatibility of e-mode GaN transistors: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6911330

8. **Q:** Describe how enhancement-mode GaN HEMTs enable bidirectional conduction and why this property is beneficial in power conversion circuits compared to silicon MOSFETs or cascode configurations.  
   **A:** Enhancement-mode GaN HEMTs can conduct current in the forward direction (drain to source) when the gate is positively biased and also conduct in the reverse direction when the drain voltage exceeds gate voltage by the threshold voltage, restoring the 2DEG. This allows fast, minority carrier-free conduction and switching without the slow recovery time typical of silicon MOSFET body diodes. Cascode configurations rely on silicon MOSFET body diodes for reverse conduction, which introduces additional voltage drop and recovery delay. Therefore, e-mode GaN HEMTs provide efficient and fast bidirectional conduction beneficial for synchronous rectification and reducing losses in power converters.

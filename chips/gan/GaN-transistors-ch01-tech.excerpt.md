Gallium nitride (GaN) transistors, particularly enhancement-mode GaN high electron mobility transistors (HEMTs), offer significant advantages over traditional silicon power MOSFETs, including higher efficiency, faster switching speeds, lower on-resistance, and smaller device size. These improvements stem from GaNâ€™s superior material properties, such as a wider band gap and higher critical electric field, enabling GaN devices to outperform silicon and silicon carbide in power conversion applications while being manufacturable on cost-effective silicon substrates.

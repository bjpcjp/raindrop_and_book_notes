1. **Q:** Explain the fundamental difference between zero-voltage switching (ZVS) and zero-current switching (ZCS) and how each technique impacts switching losses in power converters.
   **A:** ZVS eliminates turn-on commutation losses by reducing the transistor's drain-to-source voltage to zero before turn-on, discharging the output charge (QOSS) via current through the output capacitance (COSS). This prevents simultaneous high voltage and current during turn-on, thereby eliminating EOSS losses. However, ZVS does not reduce turn-off losses. Conversely, ZCS achieves soft-switching during turn-off by shaping the transistor current to go to zero before turn-off using a resonant network, virtually eliminating turn-off losses but still incurring turn-on losses including EOSS dissipation.

2. **Q:** Describe the role of the output charge (QOSS) and gate charge (QG) in resonant and soft-switching converter performance, and why QGD and QGS2 losses are less critical in these applications.
   **A:** In resonant and soft-switching converters, switching losses are minimized by achieving ZVS and ZCS, which eliminate or reduce turn-on and turn-off commutation losses. Hence, the dominant device parameters become QOSS (output charge), which impacts the energy and time to discharge the output capacitance to enable ZVS, and QG (gate charge), which dictates gate drive losses and influences the maximum switching frequency. QGD and QGS2 losses dominate in hard-switching but have little impact here because the voltage or current transitions causing those losses are shaped or eliminated by resonant operation.

3. **Q:** What is the soft-switching figure of merit (FOMSS) proposed in the document, and how does it facilitate the comparison of GaN transistors and Si MOSFETs in resonant and soft-switching applications?
   **A:** The soft-switching figure of merit (FOMSS) is defined as (QOSS + QG) × RDS(on), combining the device output charge, total gate charge, and on-resistance into a single metric that reflects the key loss contributors in resonant and soft-switching converters. Lower FOMSS indicates better device performance, enabling designers to quantitatively compare GaN transistors against Si MOSFETs, where GaN devices consistently show significantly lower FOMSS, translating to reduced ZVS transition times, gate drive losses, and improved converter efficiency.

4. **Q:** How does operation above or below the resonant frequency in a series-resonant network impact zero-voltage or zero-current switching transitions, and why is ZVS usually preferred?
   **A:** Operating above the resonant frequency makes the series-resonant tank appear inductive, causing the current to lag voltage. This produces a negative current before turn-on, enabling ZVS turn-on transitions, reducing turn-on losses but resulting in hard turn-off transitions. Operating below the resonant frequency causes the tank to appear capacitive, with current leading voltage, enabling ZCS turn-off transitions but hard turn-on transitions with associated EOSS losses. ZVS is generally preferred because it eliminates the turn-on losses associated with EOSS, which are significant in resonant and soft-switching converters.

5. **Q:** In the 48 V to 12 V high-frequency resonant bus converter example operating at 1.2 MHz, how did the GaN transistor-based design improve converter performance compared to the Si MOSFET-based design?
   **A:** The GaN transistor-based converter achieved a 2× reduction in the soft-switching FOM, leading to a halving of the ZVS transition period (42 ns vs. 87 ns), faster gate drive speed, and a longer effective power delivery duty cycle (42% vs. 34%). This resulted in approximately a 1% increase in peak efficiency (about 25% power loss reduction), reduced conduction and gate drive losses, a smaller power stage size by 30%, and enabled operation at higher switching frequencies (up to 1.6 MHz). Collectively, these improvements allowed the GaN converter to deliver higher output power with the same thermal limits.

6. **Q:** Why is accurate knowledge of COSS and QOSS across the operating voltage range crucial for designing resonant and soft-switching converters, and how do the GaN transistor and Si MOSFET capacitances differ over voltage?
   **A:** COSS and QOSS are highly non-linear and vary significantly with drain-to-source voltage. Accurate values across the operating voltage range are crucial to design appropriate timing for ZVS transitions, as insufficient discharge times or currents can lead to incomplete zero-voltage conditions, causing losses. The GaN transistor’s COSS varies by a factor of roughly 3 from 0 V to 50 V, whereas the Si MOSFET’s COSS varies by about 6× over the same range, indicating GaN devices offer more predictable and lower capacitance, facilitating more efficient ZVS operation.

7. **Q:** Explain how the soft-switching converter topology in the example uses resonant transitions and transformer leakage inductance to achieve ZVS and ZCS for primary and secondary devices, respectively.
   **A:** The topology uses the transformer’s leakage inductances (LK1, LK2) to resonate with the devices’ output capacitances (CO) during the switching dead-time. On the primary side, the magnetizing current charges and discharges the device output capacitances to create a ZVS turn-on condition, reducing turn-on losses. On the secondary side, leakage inductance resonates with CO to create a current waveform enabling ZCS turn-off transitions, reducing turn-off losses and limiting transient currents. This resonant interplay allows the converter to operate near the resonant frequency with minimal switching losses.

8. **Q:** Discuss how increasing the effective duty cycle (power delivery period relative to switching period) affects conduction losses and efficiency in resonant converters, with reference to the experimental data provided.
   **A:** Increasing the effective duty cycle reduces the resonant current’s RMS value, since conduction losses are inversely proportional to the square root of the duty cycle (I_RES ∝ 1/√D). A larger duty cycle translates to less circulating energy and lower RMS currents in passives and devices, decreasing conduction losses, improving efficiency. Experimentally, the GaN-based design achieved a 42% duty cycle vs. 34% for Si MOSFET design, correlating to about 20% reduction in conduction losses and higher peak efficiency.

Gallium nitride (GaN) transistors are poised to replace silicon power MOSFETs by offering significant improvements in switching speed, efficiency, size, and cost, enabled by their higher critical electric field and electron mobility. As GaN technology matures, it is expected to become dominant in power conversion applications due to its superior performance, reliability, and potential for further cost reductions.

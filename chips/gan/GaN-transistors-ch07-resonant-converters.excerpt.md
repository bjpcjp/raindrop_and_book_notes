This chapter discusses the fundamentals and advantages of resonant and soft-switching techniques, highlighting how enhancement-mode GaN transistors outperform silicon MOSFETs in these applications by reducing output charge and gate charge, which leads to improved efficiency and higher operating frequencies. A design example of a 48 V to 12 V high-frequency resonant intermediate bus converter operating at 1.2 MHz demonstrates GaN transistors achieving shorter zero-voltage switching transitions, increased power delivery periods, and up to a 1% efficiency improvement compared to silicon MOSFET-based designs.

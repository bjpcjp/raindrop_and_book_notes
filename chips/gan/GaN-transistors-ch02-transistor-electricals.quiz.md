1. **Q:** What are the key fundamental electrical parameters of GaN transistors critical to power system design, and how do these parameters relate to device operation and comparison with silicon MOSFETs?  
   **A:** The key fundamental electrical parameters of GaN transistors are breakdown voltage between source and drain electrodes (BVDSS), on-resistance (RDS(on)), and threshold voltage (VGS(th)). BVDSS sets the maximum blocking voltage before destructive breakdown occurs; RDS(on) defines conduction losses in the on-state; and VGS(th) determines the voltage at which the device begins to conduct. Understanding these parameters, including their temperature dependence and differences from silicon MOSFETs—such as GaN’s higher critical electric field enabling higher BVDSS, lower RDS(on) temperature coefficient, and relatively stable VGS(th) over temperature—is crucial for predicting GaN device performance in power conversion applications.  
   **External example:** The IEEE Journal of Electron Devices Society outlines similar fundamental parameters for GaN HEMTs, emphasizing their high breakdown voltage and low on-resistance advantageous over silicon devices.

2. **Q:** Describe the physical components that contribute to the on-resistance (RDS(on)) of a GaN HEMT and explain how temperature variations affect RDS(on) compared to silicon MOSFETs.  
   **A:** The on-resistance (RDS(on)) of a GaN HEMT comprises contact resistance (RC) between metal electrodes and the 2DEG, resistance of the 2DEG regions both under the gate and between electrodes, and parasitic resistances like metal bus resistance. This is modeled as RHEMT = 2·RC + R2DEG + R2DEG(Gate) plus parasitics. The 2DEG resistance dominates and increases with temperature due to reduced electron mobility, giving GaN a temperature coefficient (~6.5·10^-3/°C) lower than silicon MOSFETs (~2·10^-2/°C). Thus, GaN transistors have less increase in conduction losses with temperature, improving efficiency stability.  
   **External example:** A study from the Journal of Applied Physics confirms the components of RDS(on) and reduced temperature dependence in GaN devices versus silicon MOSFETs. [https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5034206](https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5034206)

3. **Q:** How do the capacitance characteristics of a GaN HEMT, including gate-to-source (CGS), gate-to-drain (CGD), and drain-to-source (CDS) capacitances, influence device switching, and what is the significance of the Miller ratio?  
   **A:** GaN HEMT capacitances CGS, CGD, and CDS determine energy lost during voltage transitions because the charge Q = C·V must be supplied to change terminal voltages. CGD affects the Miller capacitance (CRSS), influencing switching speed and voltage transients. The Miller ratio QGD/QGS indicates the relative contribution of gate-to-drain charge to gate-to-source charge; a high Miller ratio can cause unintended turn-on of the device during switching due to capacitive coupling, making it critical for gate driver design and ensuring stable switching. GaN devices typically show capacitances that decrease with increased drain-source voltage due to depletion of the 2DEG.  
   **External example:** The IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics explains Miller capacitance effects on GaN device switching behavior, confirming the Miller ratio’s role in controlling transient response.

4. **Q:** Explain the reverse conduction mechanisms in enhancement-mode GaN transistors and cascode devices, and compare their reverse recovery charge (QRR) with silicon MOSFETs.  
   **A:** Enhancement-mode GaN transistors conduct reverse current by turn-on of the 2DEG channel initiated by the drain-gate voltage; this body-diode behavior lacks a p-n junction and thus has no minority carrier storage, resulting in virtually zero reverse recovery charge (QRR). Cascode devices combine a depletion-mode GaN HEMT with a low-voltage Si MOSFET whose body diode conducts reverse current; thus, the cascode's QRR primarily stems from the MOSFET diode minority carriers, although it is much smaller than that of a comparable high-voltage silicon MOSFET (100x lower), reducing switching losses significantly relative to silicon devices.  
   **External example:** A paper from IEEE Electron Device Letters verifies negligible QRR in GaN HEMTs compared to silicon MOSFET diodes, emphasizing GaN’s switching efficiency advantage. [https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6701383](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6701383)

5. **Q:** What are the thermal resistance parameters defined for GaN transistors in both packaged and bare-die configurations, and how do these parameters impact thermal management in power circuits?  
   **A:** Thermal resistance parameters include junction-to-case (RθJC), junction-to-ambient (RθJA), and for double-sided bare-die or LGA devices, junction-to-board (RθJB). RθJC defines heat transfer from the die junction to the package or substrate surface; RθJB quantifies thermal path through solder bars to PCB copper traces; and RθJA includes combined resistances to ambient including convection and radiation. RθJA is the largest contributor limiting heat dissipation unless heatsinks and thermal interface materials improve cooling. Proper understanding of these parameters guides cooling solutions to prevent device overheating in power circuits.  
   **External example:** The JEDEC JESD51 series standards detail definitions of thermal resistance parameters and their application to device cooling, matching concepts described here.

6. **Q:** How is transient thermal impedance used to assess GaN transistor performance under pulsed operation, and what is the practical significance of normalized transient thermal impedance curves?  
   **A:** Transient thermal impedance characterizes how quickly a device’s junction temperature responds to short or repetitive power pulses, normalized against steady-state thermal resistance. Normalized curves show lower effective thermal resistance during short pulses or low duty cycles due to thermal mass and delayed heat flow. Designers use these curves to calculate effective thermal resistance for given pulse duration and duty cycle, allowing prediction of instantaneous junction temperature rise and ensuring reliability under dynamic conditions. This informs safe operating limits beyond continuous DC ratings.  
   **External example:** IEEE Transactions on Device and Materials Reliability discusses transient thermal impedance usage for power semiconductor switching applications, consistent with the concepts here. [https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7462702](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7462702)

7. **Q:** What is the temperature behavior of the threshold voltage (VGS(th)) in GaN enhancement-mode transistors versus silicon MOSFETs, and what underlies this difference?  
   **A:** GaN enhancement-mode transistors exhibit a relatively stable threshold voltage with temperature, changing only ~3% over typical operating ranges because the threshold depends mainly on piezoelectric strain-induced 2DEG depletion and gate barrier built-in voltages, which remain constant with temperature. In contrast, silicon MOSFET threshold voltage decreases significantly (~38%) over the same temperature range due to semiconductor bandgap narrowing and carrier mobility changes. This stability in GaN devices supports more predictable switching behavior across temperature.  
   **External example:** A review article in IEEE Electron Device Letters compares temperature dependence of Vth between GaN and Si devices, illustrating GaN’s superior stability. [https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7353033](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7353033)

8. **Q:** How do datasheet test conditions for parameters like BVDSS, IDSS, and RDS(on) differ among GaN and silicon power transistors, and what implications does this have for device comparison?  
   **A:** Datasheets for GaN transistors often specify BVDSS and IDSS at different voltage and temperature conditions than silicon devices, reflecting immature technology and variability. For example, GaN devices list transient voltage ratings above max VDS and measure IDSS at lower voltages or specific pulse durations. Silicon MOSFETs specify avalanche energy instead of transient voltage and measure leakage under standardized conditions. RDS(on) values are given at fully enhanced gate voltages and rated currents but differ in test voltages or temperatures. These differences complicate direct comparison, requiring careful normalization of conditions for fair evaluation.  
   **External example:** The IEEE Standards Association highlights standardized test conditions for power devices and notes variations in vendor datasheets, mirroring challenges in GaN vs. Si comparisons.

This chapter presents application examples demonstrating how GaN transistors outperform silicon MOSFETs by enabling higher switching frequencies, efficiencies, and power densities across various power conversion systems including non-isolated DC-DC converters, isolated converters, Class-D audio amplifiers, envelope tracking, wireless energy transfer, LiDAR, power factor correction, and motor drives. The superior figures of merit, reduced losses, and improved layout techniques of GaN devices facilitate advancements in both established and emerging applications where silicon technology is limited.

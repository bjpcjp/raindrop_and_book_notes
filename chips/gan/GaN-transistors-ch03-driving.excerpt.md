This chapter covers the critical considerations for driving high-speed GaN transistors, including gate drive voltage limits, minimizing gate loop inductance, managing dv/dt and di/dt immunity, and addressing ground bounce and common mode current to ensure reliable, high-performance operation. It also compares enhancement-mode and cascode GaN devices, emphasizing the importance of optimized gate drive design, layout techniques, and supply regulation to fully exploit GaN transistor capabilities.

This chapter analyzes the key electrical and thermal characteristics of GaN transistors, including breakdown voltage, on-resistance, threshold voltage, capacitances, reverse conduction, and thermal resistance, relating these parameters to device structure and performance in power conversion systems. It highlights the differences from silicon MOSFETs, emphasizing GaN devicesâ€™ superior switching speed, lower temperature dependence of on-resistance and threshold voltage, and distinctive reverse conduction behavior, alongside considerations for heat dissipation and transient thermal effects.

GaN transistors demonstrate superior radiation tolerance and electrical performance compared to silicon power MOSFETs, with enhancement-mode GaN HEMTs showing the ability to withstand high total ionizing doses and single-event effects while maintaining excellent switching characteristics. These attributes establish GaN devices as a new state-of-the-art solution for power conversion in harsh space radiation environments.

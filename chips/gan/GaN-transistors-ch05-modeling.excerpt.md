This chapter discusses the challenges and methods for accurately modeling and measuring GaN transistors, focusing on electrical and thermal equivalent circuit models that account for parasitic elements and thermal paths in various packaging and mounting configurations. It also highlights the increased measurement requirements due to GaN's high switching speeds, emphasizing the need for high-bandwidth instrumentation and minimal probe inductance to reliably capture the deviceâ€™s fast transient behavior.

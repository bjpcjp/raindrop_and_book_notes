This chapter analyzes hard-switching losses in power converters, detailing key loss mechanisms such as switching events, output capacitance, gate charge, reverse conduction, and reverse recovery, and shows how GaN transistors improve efficiency due to their superior electrical characteristics. A comprehensive buck converter example illustrates loss calculations including the impact of parasitic inductances, validated by experimental results demonstrating enhanced performance compared to silicon MOSFET-based converters.

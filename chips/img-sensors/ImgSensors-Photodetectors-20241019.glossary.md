- **Absorption spectra** — The range and pattern of light wavelengths absorbed by a material.  
- **Bandgap** — The energy difference between the valence and conduction bands in a semiconductor, determining light absorption.  
- **Charge Collection Narrowing (CCN)** — A method that uses the thickness of the photoactive layer to achieve narrowband photodetection by limiting charge collection.  
- **Charge Injection Narrowing (CIN)** — A technique that applies bias to enhance the narrowing of detection spectra and increase photomultiplication in photodetectors.  
- **Colloidal Quantum Dots (QDs)** — Nanocrystals stabilized by ligands with tunable optical and electronic properties based on their size.  
- **Dark current** — The electrical current flowing through a photodetector when no light is present.  
- **Detectivity (D)** — A measure of a photodetector’s sensitivity to light, indicating how well it can distinguish signal from noise.  
- **Dip Coating** — A method of depositing thin films by immersing and withdrawing a substrate from a solution.  
- **Electrophoretic Deposition (EPD)** — A solution-based technique where charged particles move and deposit onto electrodes under an electric field.  
- **External Quantum Efficiency (EQE)** — The ratio of converted charge carriers to incident photons in a photodetector.  
- **Image sensor** — An array of photodetectors designed to capture spatial images by detecting light intensity and color.  
- **Inkjet Printing** — A digital, solution-based technique to deposit precise droplets of material for device fabrication.  
- **Internal Light Depletion (ILD)** — A narrowband detection method using a depletion layer to absorb specific wavelengths before they reach the photoactive layer.  
- **Linear Dynamic Range (LDR)** — The range of light intensities over which a photodetector responds linearly to light.  
- **Noise current** — The total unwanted background electrical current in a photodetector due to various noise sources.  
- **Organic Photodetectors (OPDs)** — Photodetectors using semiconducting organic molecules or polymers as the photoactive layer.  
- **Photoconductor (PC) device** — A photodetector where light absorption generates charge carriers that change the device conductance.  
- **Photodiode (PDD)** — A layered photodetector device where electron-hole pairs separate and create current under illumination.  
- **Phototransistor (PT)** — A photodetector with transistor structure allowing gain and controlled photocurrent by gate voltage.  
- **Photoactive (PA) layer** — The material layer in photodetectors responsible for light absorption and charge generation.  
- **Quantum confinement** — The effect in nanoscale materials causing discrete energy levels and tunable optical properties.  
- **Responsivity (R)** — The electrical output current of a photodetector per unit incident light power.  
- **Solution processing** — Deposition techniques using liquid-phase materials to fabricate thin-film devices.  
- **Specific Detectivity (D*)** — Detectivity normalized to device area and bandwidth, useful for comparing photodetector sensitivity.  
- **Spin Coating** — A technique where a solution is spread onto a substrate by fast rotation to form uniform thin films.  
- **Transverse Field Detectors (TFD)** — Devices using electric fields to control the generation and collection of charge carriers by wavelength.  
- **Zeta potential** — The electric potential at the slipping plane of particles in solution, influencing stability and deposition behavior.

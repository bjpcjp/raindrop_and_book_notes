This appendix provides a detailed overview of pipelining in RISC processors, focusing on the classic five-stage MIPS pipeline, the introduction and handling of hazards (structural, data, and control), and the implementation challenges including exceptions and branch prediction. It explains how pipelining improves instruction throughput by overlapping instruction execution stages while addressing performance-limiting issues such as stalls, forwarding, precise exceptions, and control hazards through various hardware and software techniques.

This appendix provides a comprehensive review of memory hierarchy concepts, including cache and virtual memory basics, performance metrics, and optimization techniques such as block placement strategies, associativity, write policies, multilevel caches, and address translation. It emphasizes the trade-offs among hit time, miss rate, and miss penalty, detailing how these factors influence processor performance and the design of memory systems in modern computers.

This chapter explores instruction-level parallelism (ILP), focusing on techniques to exploit parallelism among instructions through hardware-based dynamic scheduling, compiler-based static scheduling, and advanced branch prediction to reduce pipeline stalls from data, control, and structural hazards. It highlights the evolution from basic pipelining to sophisticated approaches like Tomasuloâ€™s algorithm and hardware speculation for out-of-order execution, and discusses multiple-issue processors, including VLIW architectures, emphasizing strategies to enhance performance while balancing complexity and code size.

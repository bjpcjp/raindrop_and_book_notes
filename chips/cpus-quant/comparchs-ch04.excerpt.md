This chapter explores data-level parallelism through vector architectures, SIMD multimedia extensions, and GPU architectures, highlighting their differences, similarities, and programmability for efficiently executing parallel operations on large data sets. It emphasizes how these architectures manage vector processing, memory access, conditional execution, and multithreading to optimize performance, using examples like the VMIPS vector processor and NVIDIA GPUs with CUDA programming model as case studies.

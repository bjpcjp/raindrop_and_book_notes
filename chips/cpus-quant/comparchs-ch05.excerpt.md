This chapter discusses the transition from uniprocessor to multiprocessor architectures driven by limitations in uni-processor performance growth and the need to exploit thread-level parallelism (TLP) through shared-memory multiprocessors using either symmetric (SMP) centralized memory or distributed shared memory (DSM) with directory-based coherence protocols. It also covers the challenges of maintaining cache coherence, the fundamental role of cache coherence protocols (snooping and directory-based), the impact of synchronization and memory consistency models on multiprocessor performance, and the design trade-offs in performance and scalability of multiprocessor memory systems and synchronization mechanisms.

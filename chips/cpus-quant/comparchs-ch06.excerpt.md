Warehouse-scale computers (WSCs) are large datacenters architected to operate as a single powerful system, emphasizing cost-performance, energy efficiency, and dependability via redundancy to support massive Internet services and cloud computing. Their architecture integrates extensive parallelism, sophisticated networking hierarchies, and optimized physical infrastructure to balance operational and capital expenditures, enabling utility computing models exemplified by services like Amazon Web Services, which leverage economies of scale and virtualization for scalable, cost-effective computing resources.

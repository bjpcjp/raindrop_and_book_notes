This appendix reviews instruction set architecture principles, focusing on classifications, addressing modes, operand types, common operations, control flow instructions, and encoding strategies, with emphasis on compiler interactions. It culminates in presenting the MIPS architecture as a representative load-store design, while discussing common design fallacies and the evolution of instruction sets.

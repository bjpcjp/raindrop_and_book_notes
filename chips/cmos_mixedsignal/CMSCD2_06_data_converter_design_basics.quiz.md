1. **Q:** Explain why a one-bit ADC and DAC are exclusively used in passive noise-shaping modulators and how this choice impacts linearity and gain error.
   **A:** Using a one-bit ADC and DAC (with only two output codes) in a noise-shaping modulator guarantees linearity because two points define a straight line, eliminating nonlinearities caused by imperfect code spacing. Any offset in the reference voltages results only in gain error but no nonlinearity error, ensuring predictable and stable performance.
   **External example:** In delta-sigma modulators, one-bit quantizers are preferred for linearity since only gain errors occur from offsets, not nonlinearities. (Texas Instruments, "Delta-Sigma ADCs: Understanding 1-Bit vs. Multi-Bit"). https://www.ti.com/lit/an/slaa162a/slaa162a.pdf

2. **Q:** Describe the trade-offs in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) when using a passive first-order noise-shaping modulator combined with digital lowpass filtering and decimation, including the influence of filter bandwidth and oversampling ratio.
   **A:** The SNR improves as the digital lowpass filter bandwidth B decreases because less modulation noise passes through, reducing RMS noise. However, this reduces the input signal bandwidth, restricting the frequency range. Increasing decimation factor K reduces B (~fs / 2K), leading to higher resolution, with about 1.5 bits gained per doubling of K beyond 4, equating to about 9 dB SNR improvement. The RC constant must be sufficiently long (>5 times the sampling period) to minimize integrator input variation and extra distortion.
   **External example:** Oversampling combined with digital filtering improves SNR by spreading quantization noise and filtering it digitally. (IEEE Standard for Terminology and Test Methods for Analog-to-Digital Converters, IEEE Std 1241-2010). https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5512532

3. **Q:** How does adding an active integrator to a noise-shaping modulator improve linearity and remove the extra noise/distortion term present in passive modulators?
   **A:** An active integrator with large gain holds the integrator input voltage, vint, nearly constant, reducing its variation. This eliminates the extra noise/distortion term dependent on vint variations in the modulator output equation, resulting in improved linearity and better noise shaping. Consequently, the input signal is not lowpass filtered as strongly, allowing wider signal bandwidth.
   **External example:** Active integrator-based delta-sigma modulators stabilize the integrator input and improve linearity, as discussed in Analog Devices technical documentation. https://www.analog.com/en/analog-dialogue/articles/understanding-delta-sigma-adcs.html

4. **Q:** Compare the operational differences and advantages of implementing K-path noise-shaping modulators in parallel versus a single-path modulator running at an increased sampling rate, focusing on power, complexity, and clocking.
   **A:** K-path parallel modulators spread the sampling load across multiple paths clocked at fs but offset in time, thereby increasing the effective sampling frequency without increasing individual path speed beyond fs. This reduces power per path and allows relatively slower circuits. However, it increases layout area and requires multiple clock phases with precise timing. In contrast, a single path running at KÂ·fs clock frequency offers simpler routing but demands high-speed operation and settling within a shorter clock period, increasing power and complexity.
   **External example:** Time-interleaved ADCs use K parallel paths to achieve higher aggregate sampling rates while managing power and speed limitations. (IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I, "Time-Interleaved ADC Architectures and Applications"). https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/667823

5. **Q:** Derive and explain the Signal Transfer Function (STF) and Noise Transfer Function (NTF) characteristics of a second-order passive noise-shaping modulator, and contrast its SNR improvement relative to the first-order modulator.
   **A:** The second-order passive modulator has an STF with a second-order lowpass response, and an NTF that increases with the square of frequency, effectively shaping quantization noise more aggressively towards higher frequencies. This results in better noise suppression within the signal bandwidth. The SNR improves accordingly: for every doubling of oversampling ratio K, the resolution increases by approximately 2.5 bits or 15 dB (compared to 1.5 bits in first order). Proper RC selection is critical to ensure stability and low delay.
   **External example:** Higher-order sigma-delta modulators yield higher-order noise shaping, improving SNR more rapidly with oversampling ratio. (Analog Devices, "Sigma-Delta Modulators: Second-Order Noise Shaping"). https://www.analog.com/en/education/education-library/delta-sigma-adcs.html

6. **Q:** Explain the impact of resistor mismatch and comparator offset on the linearity and gain accuracy of a passive noise-shaping modulator, referencing the given equations.
   **A:** Resistor mismatch introduces gain errors because the ratios Rf/Ri deviate from ideal, but it does not cause nonlinearity or distortion, as indicated by Eq. (6.31). Similarly, comparator input offset causes the integrator input voltage to shift by the offset voltage, resulting in an offset error at the output but not nonlinearity. Therefore, both contribute primarily to gain and offset errors but leave linearity unaffected.
   **External example:** In switched-resistor circuits, resistor mismatch causes gain errors, not distortion, affecting accuracy but not linearity. (Texas Instruments, "Designing Precision Resistor Networks"). https://www.ti.com/lit/an/slva689/slva689.pdf

7. **Q:** Discuss the phenomenon of "dead zones" in the output of noise-shaping modulators, the underlying cause related to integrator input variation, and how the use of active integrators mitigates this problem.
   **A:** Dead zones occur when the modulator's output code sequence repeats for a range of input voltages, notably near the common-mode voltage, resulting in lack of output change despite input variation. This is due to the time-varying integrator input voltage vint that allows balanced feedback for these inputs. Active integrators hold vint constant, preventing these repeated output codes, and thus effectively eliminating dead zones and improving linearity.
   **External example:** Dead zones in sigma-delta modulators vanish with high-gain active integrator designs that stabilize loop voltages. (IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits, "Dead Zone Reduction in Sigma-Delta Modulators Using Active Integrators"). https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/570900

8. **Q:** Describe the role of switched-capacitor implementations in noise-shaping modulators compared to continuous-time resistive implementations, citing benefits and challenges.
   **A:** Switched-capacitor (SC) implementations replace resistors with capacitors switched at clock frequency, making feedback pulse shape less critical since capacitors fully charge/discharge within each clock cycle. This reduces distortion from non-ideal pulse shapes, enhancing linearity. However, SC modulators require non-overlapping clock generation and precise timing, adding power consumption and layout complexity. Further, settling time constraints restrict increasing the sampling frequency or using K-path architectures with SC.
   **External example:** SC sigma-delta modulators leverage capacitor switching for precise time-invariant resistance, improving linearity (Analog Devices Tutorial, "Switched-Capacitor Integrators"). https://www.analog.com/en/education/education-library/design-guide-switched-capacitor-integrators.html

9. **Q:** Explain how the addition of a feedback amplifier with gain G in front of comparator inputs affects the offset influence, signal transfer, and noise behavior in a multi-path noise-shaping modulator.
   **A:** The amplifier with gain G reduces the effect of comparator offsets by referring them back to the input of the integrator divided by G, making mismatch-induced offsets negligible. Increasing G also reduces the lowpass filtering of the input signal (feeding wider bandwidth to the output), but the extra noise/distortion dependent on vint variation remains and requires vint stabilization. However, raising G too much effectively reduces comparator gain, potentially affecting overall modulator stability.
   **External example:** Front-end gain amplifiers in delta-sigma ADCs reduce comparator offset impacts but must balance gain and speed for stability (Texas Instruments, "Delta-Sigma ADC Front-End Design"). https://www.ti.com/lit/wp/sbaa040a/sbaa040a.pdf

10. **Q:** What are the fundamental limitations and design considerations when implementing K-path switched-capacitor noise-shaping modulators for high-speed ADCs?
    **A:** As K-path SC modulators operate in parallel with clock edges spaced by Ts/K, capacitors must settle within Ts/K, demanding extremely fast settling and comparator response times, limiting practical speed. The noise-transfer-function acts as a comb filter instead of a differentiator, reducing noise-shaping effectiveness. Keeping integration shared and using appropriate clocking schemes with wide pulses mitigate timing challenges, but complexity and layout increase. Generating multiple precise phase-shifted clocks (via DLLs) is necessary.
    **External example:** K-path time-interleaved SC modulators face settling and clock distribution challenges limiting speed scaling (IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II, "Challenges in K-Path Time-Interleaved Delta-Sigma Modulators"). https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5634289

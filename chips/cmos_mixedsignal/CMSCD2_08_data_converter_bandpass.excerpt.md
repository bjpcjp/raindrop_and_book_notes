Bandpass data converters perform analog-to-digital conversion on frequency bands that exclude DC, making them especially useful for communication systems where information is modulated at higher frequencies within fixed bandwidths. This chapter develops bandpass modulator topologies using continuous-time and switched-capacitor approaches, highlighting implementations, stability considerations, signal-to-noise ratio estimation, and the advantage of digital I/Q extraction for demodulating bandpass signals.

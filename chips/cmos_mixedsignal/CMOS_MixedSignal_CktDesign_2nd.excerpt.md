This text provides a comprehensive introduction to mixed-signal circuit design, focusing on fundamental concepts such as sinusoidal signals, complex representation, comb filters, digital filtering, data converter design, and the effects of sampling and aliasing. It emphasizes the mathematical and physical understanding of these topics, including the importance of the Nyquist frequency, the operation of sampling circuits like sample-and-hold, and the need for anti-aliasing and reconstruction filters in mixed-signal systems.

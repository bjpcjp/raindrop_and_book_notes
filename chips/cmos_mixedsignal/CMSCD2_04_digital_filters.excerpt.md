This chapter focuses on the implementation and SPICE modeling of ideal DACs and ADCs for mixed-signal circuit design and extensively discusses sinc-shaped digital filters, including their use in interpolation and decimation, as well as their frequency response characteristics and aliasing effects. Additionally, it covers various filtering topologies, emphasizing integrator-based recursive filters, FIR filters, and bilinear and biquadratic transfer functions, highlighting stability considerations, overflow prevention, and practical design examples.

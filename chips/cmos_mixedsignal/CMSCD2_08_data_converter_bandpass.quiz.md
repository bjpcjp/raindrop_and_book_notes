1. **Q:** Explain the principle of bandpass data converters and how they differ from lowpass data converters in terms of frequency range and applications.
   **A:** Bandpass data converters perform analog-to-digital conversion on a bandwidth of frequencies that does not include DC but is centered around a carrier frequency \( f_c \). Unlike lowpass converters that convert signals from DC to a cutoff frequency \( B \), bandpass converters target a fixed frequency band higher in the spectrum, which is beneficial in communication systems where information is modulated onto high-frequency carriers. This enables direct digitization of modulated RF signals without downconversion to baseband.
   **External example:** RF bandpass delta-sigma converters directly digitize intermediate frequency signals, improving integration in wireless systems. See: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6800247

2. **Q:** Derive how in-phase (I) and quadrature (Q) components can be recovered from an I/Q modulated signal \( S_{IQ}(t) = A_I \cos(2\pi f_c t) + A_Q \sin(2\pi f_c t) \) and explain the role of lowpass filtering in this process.
   **A:** Multiplying \( S_{IQ}(t) \) by \(\cos(2\pi f_c t)\) and applying trigonometric identities splits it into a desired baseband \( A_I \) term plus higher frequency components at \( 2f_c \), which are removed by lowpass filtering. Similarly, multiplying by \(\sin(2\

- **ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter)** — A device that converts continuous analog signals into discrete digital numbers.
- **DAI (Discrete Analog Integrator)** — An integrator implemented using switched-capacitor techniques, typically with clocked operation.
- **DAC (Digital-to-Analog Converter)** — A device that converts digital numbers into continuous analog signals.
- **Decimation filter** — A digital filter used to remove out-of-band noise and reduce the sampling rate of the modulator output.
- **Digital filter** — A processing block that shapes, filters, or decimates the digital output of the modulator.
- **Differentiator (Digital)** — A filter with transfer function \(1 - z^{-1}\), used in noise shaping to push noise to higher frequencies.
- **Dither** — A purposely added noise source used to randomize quantization errors and reduce tones or limit cycles.
- **Error Feedback Modulator** — A noise-shaping topology where the quantization error is fed back digitally rather than fed back in analog form.
- **Forward gain (GF)** — The overall gain of the forward path in a modulator, typically the product of the integrator and comparator gains.
- **Integrator gain (GI)** — Gain setting of an integrator stage that affects signal swing and stability.
- **Limit cycle oscillations** — Periodic digital output patterns due to DC input in noise-shaping modulators, producing unwanted tones.
- **Loop filter** — The filter consisting of integrators and feedback paths defining the modulator’s noise shaping.
- **Modulation noise** — Quantization noise after being shaped by the noise transfer function (NTF).
- **Multibit modulator** — A noise-shaping modulator that uses a multibit quantizer and DAC to improve SNR and stability.
- **Noise transfer function (NTF)** — The transfer function that shapes the quantization noise spectrum in a noise-shaping modulator.
- **Noise shaping (NS)** — Technique that pushes the quantization noise to higher frequencies to improve in-band SNR.
- **Oversampling ratio (K)** — Ratio of the sampling frequency to twice the signal bandwidth; higher values reduce in-band noise.
- **Quantization noise** — Error introduced by quantizing an analog signal into discrete levels.
- **RMS quantization noise (VQe,RMS)** — Root-mean-square value of the quantization noise within the signal bandwidth.
- **Signal transfer function (STF)** — The transfer function that passes the input signal through the modulator to output.
- **Sinc filter** — A digital averaging filter used as a decimation filter after a noise-shaping modulator.
- **Stability (modulator)** — Condition when poles of the system lie within the unit circle in the z-plane, ensuring bounded output.
- **Unity gain frequency (fun)** — Frequency at which the gain of an op-amp falls to unity, relevant for integrator settling time.
- **Z-domain (z-transform)** — Mathematical domain used to analyze discrete-time signals and systems.

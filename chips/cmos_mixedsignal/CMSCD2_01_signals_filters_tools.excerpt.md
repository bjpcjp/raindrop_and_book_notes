This chapter provides a foundational overview of signals, filtering, and mathematical tools essential for mixed-signal circuit design, focusing on the representation and manipulation of sinusoidal signals, the complex plane, and the z-domain. It introduces key concepts such as in-phase and quadrature signals, comb filters, digital integrators, and Fourier series and transforms to analyze periodic and non-periodic signals in both time and frequency domains.

This chapter explores first-order and higher-order noise-shaping (NS) data converters, detailing their topologies, quantization noise behavior, and practical circuit implementations, including integrator gain considerations and digital filtering techniques. It further discusses advanced concepts such as multi-bit modulators, error-feedback architectures, and cascaded modulators, emphasizing stability analysis, noise-transfer function design, and methods to improve signal-to-noise ratio through oversampling and noise shaping.

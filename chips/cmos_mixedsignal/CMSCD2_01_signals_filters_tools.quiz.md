1. **Q:** Explain how the pendulum analogy in Section 1.1.1 helps to intuitively understand a sinusoidal signal and describe the mathematical relationship expressed by the sine function for the pendulum’s position over time.
   **A:** The pendulum analogy represents sinusoidal motion as the ideal lossless pendulum moves back and forth between two points, with its position over time forming a repeating pattern called the period (T). The pendulum starts slow, gains maximum speed at the midpoint, then reverses direction. Mathematically, the relative position \( f(t) \) is represented as a sine function: \( f(t) = \sin\left(2\pi f_o t\right) \) where \( f_o = 1/T \), which corresponds to the angular displacement mapped onto a circle. This models the position of the pendulum as a sinusoid repeating every period.
   **External example:** The forced oscillation of a mass-spring system models sinusoidal motion analogously to the pendulum, described by \( x(t) = A \sin(\omega t + \phi) \).

2. **Q:** Describe how in-phase (I) and quadrature (Q) signals are represented and combined in the x-y plane, including the effect on amplitude and phase of adding these two components.
   **A:** The I and Q signals, being cosine and sine components respectively, are orthogonal and can be represented as vectors in the x-y plane: the cosine (in-phase) lies along the x-axis and sine (quadrature) along the y-axis. Their sum creates a vector whose length is the peak amplitude, calculated as \( \sqrt{A_I^2 + A_Q^2} \), and whose phase angle is \( \tan^{-1}(A_Q / A_I) \), representing rotation in the plane. Adding I and Q components at the same frequency but shifted by 90 degrees results in a rotating vector with frequency \( f_o \) and amplitude related to both components.
   **External example:** Quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) encodes data using in-phase and quadrature signals combined as vectors, enabling complex signal constellations. [Texas Instruments QAM explanation](https://www.ti.com/lit/an/slyt701/slyt701.pdf)

3. **Q:** How does Euler’s formula facilitate the representation and manipulation of sinusoidal signals in discrete-time systems, and what is the importance of the complex (z-) plane in this context?
   **A:** Euler’s formula expresses sine and cosine functions as complex exponentials: \( e^{j\theta} = \cos\theta + j\sin\theta \). This allows sinusoidal signals to be manipulated using exponential properties, simplifying operations like phase shifts and multiplication into additions of exponents. The z-plane represents these complex exponentials where frequency-dependent behavior maps onto points on the unit circle. Plotting poles and zeros in the z-plane enables intuitive analysis of the system’s frequency response and stability in discrete-time systems.
   **External example:** Digital filter design uses the z-plane to analyze filter stability and frequency response via pole-zero plots. [University of Cambridge Digital Signal Processing notes](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/teaching/1011/DSP/lect2.pdf)

4. **Q:** Derive and explain the magnitude and phase responses of an analog comb filter formed by adding an input signal and its delayed version. How does this filter reject certain frequencies?
   **A:** The comb filter output is \( v_{out} = v_{in} + v_{in} e^{-j2\pi f t_d} \). Using Euler’s formula, the magnitude response is \( |v_{out}/v_{in}| = 2 \cos(\pi f t_d) \), and the phase response is \( \phi = \tan^{-1} \left( \frac{-\sin(2\pi f t_d)}{1 + \cos(2\pi f t_d)} \right) \), which simplifies to linear phase related to delay. Frequencies at which \( \cos(\pi f t_d) = 0 \), i.e., multiples of \( 1/(2 t_d) \), result in zero output (complete cancellation), creating nulls at these frequencies and thus rejecting them, giving the periodic "comb" response.
   **External example:** Notch filters built using feedback delays emulate comb filter behavior to suppress specific harmonics in audio processing. [Analog Devices Comb Filter application](https://www.analog.com/en/analog-dialogue/articles/design-and-analysis-of-a-comb-filter.html)

5. **Q:** What is the z-domain transfer function and frequency response of a one-delay digital comb filter (averaging filter), and how does its frequency response explain its zero output at certain input frequencies?
   **A:** The transfer function of the digital comb filter is \( H(z) = \frac{1 + z^{-1}}{2} \). Its frequency response is \( |H(f)| = \cos(\pi f / f_s) \), with \( f_s \) being the sampling frequency. The filter averages an input with its delayed version by one sample period. Its output is zero at \( f = f_s / 2 \) because the inputs are \( 180^\circ \) out of phase and cancel, corresponding to the zero in the frequency response at the Nyquist frequency.
   **External example:** Moving average filters in DSP attenuate frequencies at half the sampling rate, used in noise reduction. [DSP Guide on Moving Average Filters](https://dsp.stackexchange.com/questions/3155/why-moving-average-filter-is-low-pass)

6. **Q:** Explain the concept of poles and zeros in the z-plane and how their positions determine the frequency response (both magnitude and phase) of a discrete-time system.
   **A:** Poles in the z-plane are points where the denominator of the transfer function is zero, causing the system response to potentially diverge, and zeros are points where the numerator is zero, causing attenuation. The frequency response is evaluated along the unit circle where \( z = e^{j2\pi f T_s} \). The magnitude response at a frequency corresponds to the ratio of distances from the evaluation point on the unit circle to zeros and poles; phase is the difference in angles from these points to the evaluation point. Poles near the unit circle induce peaks, zeros near unit circle cause nulls in frequency response.
   **External example:** MATLAB’s freqz function analyzes filter frequency response from pole-zero locations plotted in the z-plane. [MathWorks freqz documentation](https://www.mathworks.com/help/signal/ref/freqz.html)

7. **Q:** Contrast the digital averaging comb filter with the digital differentiator comb filter, focusing on their transfer functions, magnitude responses, and behavior at DC.
   **A:** The averaging comb filter’s transfer function is \( H(z) = \frac{1 + z^{-1}}{2} \), has a magnitude response \( 2 \cos(\pi f / f_s) \), and gain of 2 at DC. The differentiator comb filter has \( H(z) = \frac{1 - z^{-1}}{2} \), with magnitude \( 2 \sin(\pi f / f_s) \), and gain zero at DC. The averaging filter passes low frequencies and attenuates high (comb with peaks at DC), while the differentiator filter blocks DC and passes higher frequencies, with zeros at DC, serving as a highpass comb filter.
   **External example:** Digital differentiators are used for edge detection in signals; averaging filters smooth signals and attenuate high frequency noise.

8. **Q:** How are signals with multiple frequency components represented using the exponential Fourier series, and how do the Fourier transform and the Dirac delta function extend this representation to non-periodic signals?
   **A:** Periodic signals are decomposed into sums of sinusoids at integer multiples (harmonics) of a base frequency via the exponential Fourier series: \( g(t) = \sum_n c_n e^{j2\pi n f t} \) with weights \( c_n \). For non-periodic signals, the Fourier transform generalizes this into a continuous spectrum of frequencies, integrating components weighted by their spectral content. The Dirac delta function represents idealized impulses in time or frequency, enabling representation of discrete frequency components within continuous transforms.
   **External example:** Fourier transforms are fundamental in spectrum analysis of signals, with impulses represented by delta functions in frequency domain. [IEEE Spectrum: Fourier Transform basics](https://spectrum.ieee.org/fourier-transform-explained)

9. **Q:** Derive the transfer function of a non-delaying digital integrator and explain its magnitude and phase response in the z-plane and frequency domain.
   **A:** The non-delaying integrator output is \( v_{out}[n] = v_{in}[n] + v_{out}[n-1] \). Its z-domain transfer function is \( H(z) = \frac{1}{1 - z^{-1}} \) with a pole at \( z=1 \). The magnitude response is \( |H(f)| = \frac{1}{2|\sin(\pi f / f_s)|} \), indicating gain increases at low frequencies, approaching infinity at DC. Phase response is approximately \(-90^\circ\) at low frequencies, shifting to 0 as frequency approaches Nyquist, indicating a lagging integrator behavior.
   **External example:** Digital accumulators (integrators) are building blocks for IIR filters, modeled by \( \frac{1}{1-z^{-1}} \). [NI Digital Signal Processing Fundamentals](https://www.ni.com/en-us/innovations/white-papers/10/introduction-to-digital-filtering.html)

10. **Q:** What is the significance of the Nyquist frequency in discrete-time systems concerning signal aliasing and filter design, as discussed in relation to the digital comb filters?
    **A:** The Nyquist frequency \( (f_s/2) \) defines the highest frequency component that can be correctly sampled without aliasing in discrete-time systems. Signals with frequency components above the Nyquist frequency fold back (alias) into lower frequency bands, causing distortion. Digital filters, like the comb filters discussed, must operate considering this limit to avoid introducing aliased components or misinterpreting inputs, and input signals to digital filters should be band-limited below \( f_s/2 \).
    **External example:** The Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem states sampling frequency must be at least twice the highest signal frequency to avoid aliasing. [ITU-R Sampling Theorem](https://www.itu.int/dms_pubrec/itu-r/rec/bs/R-REC-BS.468-4-198607-I!!PDF-E.pdf)

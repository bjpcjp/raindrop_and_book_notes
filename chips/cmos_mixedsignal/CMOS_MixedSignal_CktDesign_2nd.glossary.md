- **Quadrature (Q) Signal** — The sine component of an I/Q signal pair, representing the part shifted by 90 degrees relative to the reference oscillator.  
- **Reconstruction Filter (RCF)** — An analog lowpass filter used to smooth or reconstruct a continuous-time signal from its sampled discrete-time form.  
- **Sample-and-Hold (S/H)** — A circuit that samples an input voltage and holds it constant for a specified period, enabling conversion by ADCs.  
- **Sampling Frequency (f_s)** — The rate at which an analog signal is sampled in time, determining the spacing of spectral replicas.

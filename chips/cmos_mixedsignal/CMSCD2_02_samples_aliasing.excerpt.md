This chapter discusses the principles and circuit implementations of sampling and aliasing in mixed-signal systems, focusing on impulse sampling, sample-and-hold (S/H), track-and-hold (T/H), decimation, interpolation, and discrete analog integrators (DAIs). It details the spectral effects of sampling methods, design considerations for anti-aliasing and reconstruction filters, and practical mixed-signal building blocks including S/H circuits with gain, correlated double sampling, and switched-capacitor integrators, emphasizing noise, offset, and timing considerations.

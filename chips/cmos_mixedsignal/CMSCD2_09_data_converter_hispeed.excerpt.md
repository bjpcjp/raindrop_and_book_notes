This chapter presents a high-speed analog-to-digital converter topology using a single integrator with multiple switched-capacitor feedback paths, enabling effective sampling frequencies much higher than the clock frequency by time-interleaving. The approach balances rapid sampling with noise shaping, employing digital filtering and decimation techniques to manage signal bandwidth and resolution, while practical implementation addresses clock generation, component design, and timing challenges.

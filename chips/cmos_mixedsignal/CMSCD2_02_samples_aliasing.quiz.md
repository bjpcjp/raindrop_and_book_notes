1. **Q:** Explain the role and ideal characteristics of the anti-aliasing filter (AAF) and the reconstruction filter (RCF) in a mixed-signal system, and how they interact with the sampling frequency.
   **A:** The AAF limits the input signal’s spectral content to below the Nyquist frequency (fs/2) to prevent aliasing when sampling. Ideally, it is an analog lowpass filter with unity gain below fn = fs/2 and complete attenuation above fn, with linear phase to avoid distortion of the wanted signals. The RCF smooths the reconstruction output after D/A conversion by removing spectral content above fn to reconstruct the analog waveform accurately. It also has the same ideal filtering characteristics as the AAF. Both filters ensure the correct band-limited processing of signals in continuous and discrete domains in mixed-signal designs.

2. **Q:** Describe the spectral consequences of impulse sampling of a sinewave input, including the concepts of spectrum repetition and aliasing, and illustrate with a numerical example.
   **A:** Impulse sampling replicates the input signal's spectrum at multiples of the sampling frequency fs, creating periodic copies spaced by fs. If the input frequency fin is greater than fs/2 (the Nyquist frequency), spectral replicas overlap into the baseband, causing aliasing where a higher frequency appears as a lower “aliased” frequency in the sampled signal. For instance, sampling a 60 MHz sinewave at 100 MHz results in replicas at fs ± fin = 40 MHz and 160 MHz; after lowpass filtering, the output appears as a 40 MHz signal—the alias of the original 60 MHz tone.

3. **Q:** Compare impulse sampling and sample-and-hold (S/H) sampling in terms of spectral response, specifically focusing on the effect of the sample-and-hold's "Sinc" frequency weighting and its implications for distortion and anti-aliasing filtering.
   **A:** Impulse sampling produces exact copies of the input spectrum repeated every fs frequency. Sample-and-hold sampling effectively multiplies the impulse sampling spectrum by a Sinc function, resulting in amplitude weighting that attenuates signals near fs/2, causing a “droop” of about 3.9 dB at the Nyquist frequency. This Sinc distortion introduces signal attenuation but cannot serve as an anti-aliasing filter; higher frequencies beyond fs/2 still produce aliases. The S/H output must still be passed through an analog reconstruction filter (RCF) to recover the original signal bandwidth accurately.
   **External example:** “Sample-and-hold circuits inherently roll off frequency response near half the sampling rate due to the zero-order hold,” [Analog Devices – Zero-Order Hold](https://www.analog.com/en/analog-dialogue/articles/sample-and-hold.html)

4. **Q:** Explain the principles and spectral effects of decimation and interpolation in digital sampling systems, including how they relate to changes in sample rate and the role of anti-aliasing and image removal filters.
   **A:** Decimation reduces the sample rate by a factor K by lowpass filtering the input digital data to limit the bandwidth to fs/(2K) and then discarding samples, preventing aliasing at the lower output sample rate. Interpolation increases the sample rate by inserting zero-padding or holding samples between input values and passing the extended data through an image removal filter to smooth and suppress spectral images introduced by zero padding or sample concatenation. Both processes require appropriate filtering: decimation uses an anti-aliasing filter before downsampling, while interpolation uses an image removal filter after upsampling.
   **External example:** “Decimation reduces data rate and avoids aliasing by filtering, whereas interpolation increases sample rate and suppresses images using filtering.” [TI – Decimation and Interpolation Filters](https://www.ti.com/lit/an/slyt366/slyt366.pdf)

5. **Q:** Discuss the operation of the discrete analog integrator (DAI) in switched-capacitor circuits, including the significance of the parasitic-insensitive design, the various input/output delay configurations, and how the DAI transfer functions relate to sampling frequencies.
   **A:** The DAI transfers charge differences between input signals v1 and v2 on capacitors through capacitive ratios to the feedback capacitor, integrating the input over time. The parasitic-insensitive design charges the bottom plate of CI alternately at v1 and v2, so parasitic capacitances do not affect charge sampling, leading to accurate integration. Different clocking and output connection schemes (switching through I1 or I2) introduce delays of z or z^(1/2), corresponding to full or half sample periods, affecting the phase but not magnitude. The transfer function exhibits discrete-time integrating behavior with poles near z=1, and the integration rate and spectral response are scaled by capacitor ratios and sampling frequency.
   **External example:** “Switched-capacitor discrete-time integrators achieve precise analog integration while being insensitive to parasitic capacitances.” [IEEE – High-Speed Switched-Capacitor Integrator](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/869646)

6. **Q:** Analyze the factors determining the op-amp requirements (gain, bandwidth) in a sample-and-hold (S/H) circuit, including the role of settling time and achievable resolution.
   **A:** The finite op-amp gain-bandwidth product (unity-gain frequency, fun) dictates settling time after the sample switch opens. To meet a target resolution and sampling frequency fs, the settling time must be less than half the clock period (Ts/2), requiring the closed-loop bandwidth to accommodate the required settling accuracy. An op-amp with higher DC gain AOLDC reduces offset, and a higher fun (product of AOLDC and 3 dB bandwidth) enables faster settling. For example, 1 mV resolution at 100 MHz sampling requires an op-amp gain >1000 and fun >210 MHz.
   **External example:** “Op-amp gain and bandwidth must be sufficient to settle the output before the next sample in precision S/H circuits.” [Analog Devices – Op Amp Settling](https://www.analog.com/en/analog-dialogue/articles/understanding-op-amp-settling-times.html)

7. **Q:** Explain the autozeroing (correlated double sampling - CDS) technique in S/H circuits, including its effect on offset and noise components and limitations related to noise bandwidth.
   **A:** Autozeroing samples the offset and low-frequency noise during one clock phase and subtracts it during the hold phase, effectively removing DC offset and low-frequency (e.g., flicker) noise. This results in reduced low-frequency noise and offset in the output. The noise transfer function is sinusoidal, attenuating low frequencies but passing high-frequency noise, which depends on the switching clock frequency, so fast noise components are not completely suppressed. Therefore, autozeroing effectively removes slow-varying noise and offset but not high-frequency noise beyond fs/2.
   **External example:** “Correlated double sampling reduces offset and low-frequency noise by sampling and subtracting the noise in consecutive phases.” [IEEE – Autozero and Chopper-Stabilized Circuits](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5640267)

8. **Q:** Describe how subtraction and gain can be implemented in a switched-capacitor Sample-and-Hold circuit, including the role of the capacitor bottom-plate voltage control and the resulting output voltage expression.
   **A:** Subtraction is performed by feeding the bottom plates of the input capacitors CI to a reference voltage difference (VCI+ and VCI-), effectively subtracting VCI+ - VCI- from the sampled input signal. Gain is set by the ratio of CI/CF capacitors. The output voltage thus equals the scaled input voltage by (1 + CI/CF) minus the similarly scaled reference voltage difference, allowing the S/H to realize both subtraction and gain in one analog step before ADC conversion.
   **External example:** “Switched-capacitor circuits can perform precise gain and offset adjustment by manipulating capacitor connections and reference voltages.” [Texas Instruments – Switched-Capacitor Circuits Primer](https://www.ti.com/lit/an/slyy003b/slyy003b.pdf)

9. **Q:** Summarize the differences between single-ended to fully-differential S/H conversion topologies and their implications on offset and noise cancellation.
   **A:** Single-ended to fully-differential S/H converters use input capacitors feeding differential op-amp inputs, redistributing charge to create differential outputs from a single-ended input. Such configurations do not employ correlated double sampling (CDS), so offset and noise are not automatically canceled, resulting in potentially higher residual offset and noise. The factor of two in offset is due to the splitting of offset voltage between inverting and non-inverting inputs. Compensating for offset requires careful design since CDS is not inherently applied.
   **External example:** “Single-ended to fully-differential converters require explicit offset correction mechanisms due to inherent differential offsets.” [Analog Devices – Fully-Differential ADCs and Front Ends](https://www.analog.com/en/analog-dialogue/articles/fully-differential-adcs-explained.html)

10. **Q:** What are the thermal noise considerations in determining the capacitor sizes in switched-capacitor Sample-and-Hold and integrator circuits, and how does this impact the design trade-offs?
    **A:** Thermal noise voltage power spectral density is proportional to kT/C, so smaller capacitors increase noise voltage, limiting SNR. Larger capacitors reduce thermal noise but increase power consumption and slow settling time. Table 2.1 quantifies RMS and peak-to-peak noise voltages for various capacitor sizes at 300 K, guiding the minimal capacitor sizing to meet noise targets. Designers must balance minimizing capacitor area and power with required noise performance.

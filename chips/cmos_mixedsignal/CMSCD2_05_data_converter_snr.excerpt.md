This chapter focuses on quantization noise in data converters, describing its spectral characteristics, impact on signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and methods to model and measure it, including the effects of clock jitter and averaging. It also introduces feedback modulator topologies, such as predictive and noise-shaping modulators, which improve resolution and SNR by shaping quantization noise and relaxing analog component accuracy requirements.

1. **Q:** Explain the relationship and differences between the sampling frequency, input signal frequency, and the Nyquist frequency in the context of impulse sampling and aliasing, as described in the text.
   **A:** Sampling a signal at frequency \( f_s \) replicates its spectrum at multiples of \( f_s \). To avoid aliasing, the input signal's spectral content must be limited to below the Nyquist frequency \( f_n = f_s/2 \). Frequencies above \( f_n \) fold back into the baseband after sampling, causing aliasing. An anti-aliasing filter (AAF) restricts input bandwidth to below \( f_n \), and a reconstruction filter (RCF) removes spectral images after sampling.

2. **Q:** Describe how an ideal reconstruction filter's (RCF) impulse response leads to practical implementation challenges and explain the role of oversampling and interpolation in addressing these challenges.
   **A:** The ideal RCF is an ideal brick-wall lowpass filter with linear phase, having an impulse response given by a sinc function extending infinitely in time (including negative time), which cannot be physically realized because it anticipates the input signal. Practically, this infinite, non-causal impulse response is impossible to implement. To ease filter design, oversampling increases the sampling frequency far beyond the maximum signal frequency, widening the transition band, and interpolation increases the DSP output sampling rate, both reducing the RCF's stringent requirements.

3. **Q:** Compare the spectral response and distortion implications between ideal impulse sampling and practical sample-and-hold (S/H) sampling, including the impact of pulse width \( T \) on the S/H frequency response.
   **A:** Ideal impulse sampling reproduces multiple spectral replicas without amplitude weighting, while the practical S/H holds the sampled value over time \( T \), effectively convolving the impulse spectrum with a rectangular pulse spectrum. This results in a frequency response shaped by a sinc function causing amplitude "droop" (attenuation) near Nyquist frequency, introducing signal distortion. Smaller \( T \) approaches ideal impulse sampling but reduces output signal power.

4. **Q:** Using the complex (z-) plane representation, describe how a digital delay and digital comb filter are characterized, including the interpretation of poles, zeros, and their relation to the unit circle.
   **A:** A digital delay of one sample period is represented in the z-plane as multiplication by \( z^{-1} = e^{-j2\pi f T_s} \), lying on the unit circle with magnitude 1 and phase shift proportional to frequency. A digital comb filter has a transfer function \( H(z) = \frac{1 - z^{-K}}{1 - z^{-1}} \), with zeros on the unit circle spaced evenly, creating periodic nulls in the frequency response. Poles and zeros plotted on the z-plane unit circle indicate filter magnitude and phase response at corresponding frequencies, with magnitude calculated as the ratio of distances from zeros to poles to the evaluation point on the unit circle.

5. **Q:** What are the key differences between delaying and non-delaying digital integrators in terms of their transfer functions, magnitude, and phase response according to the document?
   **A:** The non-delaying integrator's output at time \( nT_s \) sums input values up to \( nT_s \), with transfer function \( H(z) = \frac{1}{1 - z^{-1}} \). The delaying integrator includes a delay in the forward path, with transfer function \( H(z) = \frac{z^{-1}}{1 - z^{-1}} \). Both have the same magnitude response \( |H(f)| = \frac{1}{2|\sin(\pi f / f_s)|} \). Their phase responses differ by 90째, with the non-delaying integrator having a phase shift starting at -90째 at DC, while the delaying integrator has additional delay causing a phase shift starting at -180째 at DC.

6. **Q:** How is decimation implemented in digital systems and what are the necessary conditions on the input signal to avoid aliasing after down-sampling?
   **A:** Decimation reduces the digital sample rate from \( f_s \) to \( f_s / K \) by first applying a digital low-pass anti-aliasing filter to remove components above \( f_s/(2K) \), then down-sampling by retaining every \( K \)-th sample and discarding the rest. To avoid aliasing, input spectral content must be restricted to below \( f_s/(2K) \) before decimation.

7. **Q:** Describe the significance of In-Phase (I) and Quadrature (Q) signals and how their combination extends the capability of signal representation as presented in the text.
   **A:** I and Q signals are sinusoids at the same frequency but 90째 phase-shifted. Representing signals as \( A_I \cos(2\pi f_o t) + A_Q \sin(2\pi f_o t) \) allows encoding amplitude and phase information independently, effectively representing the signal as a rotating vector in the complex plane. Combining I and Q components enables transmission of additional information within the same bandwidth, such as in communications for modulation schemes like QAM.

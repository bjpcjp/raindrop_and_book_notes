This chapter discusses the design of mixed-signal analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) using noise-shaping (NS) modulators, focusing on one-bit ADCs and DACs to guarantee linearity and exploring passive and active NS modulator topologies for improving signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and linearity. It details the operation, benefits, and limitations of first- and second-order modulators, switched-capacitor implementations, K-path configurations for higher effective sampling rates, and the role of active integrators in minimizing distortion and enhancing modulator performance.

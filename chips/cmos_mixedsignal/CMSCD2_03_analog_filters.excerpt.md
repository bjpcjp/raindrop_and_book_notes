This chapter discusses analog filters used in mixed-signal systems, focusing on practical designs implemented with continuous-time analog integrators, MOSFET-C integrators, transconductor-capacitor (gm-C) integrators, and discrete-time analog integrators (DAIs). It explores filter topologies such as first-order lowpass filters, bilinear and biquadratic transfer functions, and details design considerations including frequency response, effects of finite op-amp gain bandwidth, tuning, stability issues, and implementations using active-RC, MOSFET-C, gm-C, and switched-capacitor circuits.

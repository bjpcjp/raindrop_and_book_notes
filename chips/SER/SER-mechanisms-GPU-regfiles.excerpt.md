This paper presents two techniques—register value compression at warp or thread-level and selective hardening of register file portions—to enhance soft-error resilience in GPU register files, leveraging value similarity and narrow-width data to reduce vulnerable bits and combining these methods to achieve higher reliability with minimal overhead. Experimental results using diverse GPU workloads demonstrate that warp-level compression achieves up to 47% reduction and thread-level compression 40.8% reduction in soft-error vulnerability, while selective hardening further improves resilience with limited performance impact.

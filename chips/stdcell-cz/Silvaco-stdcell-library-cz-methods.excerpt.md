Cell characterization involves creating accurate and efficient models of standard cell libraries used by various digital design tools to represent cell behavior, including attributes such as timing, power, and delay. These models are typically described in the Liberty format and include detailed information on timing arcs, delay equations, lookup tables, and timing constraints to enable precise static timing analysis and design optimization.

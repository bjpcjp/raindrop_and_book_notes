- **Aperture Efficiency** — The ratio of an antenna's effective radiating area to its physical aperture area, indicating how effectively it uses its aperture to transmit or receive power.  
- **Antenna Gain** — A measure of the ability of an antenna to direct radio frequency energy in a particular direction, compared to an isotropic source.  
- **Bessel Functions** — Solutions to certain differential equations important in wave and diffusion problems, often used in antenna and electromagnetic theory.  
- **Beamwidth (3 dB)** — The angular width of the main lobe of an antenna radiation pattern where the power falls to half its peak value.  
- **Boltzmann's Constant (k)** — A fundamental physical constant relating temperature to energy, used in noise and thermal calculations.  
- **Coaxial Cable** — A type of transmission line used for carrying radio frequency signals with specific loss characteristics.  
- **Cosmic Background Noise Temperature** — The effective temperature representing noise power from cosmic sources in a radio system.  
- **Doppler Radar** — A radar system that measures the velocity of a target by detecting frequency shifts of the returned signal.  
- **EIRP (Effective Isotropic Radiated Power)** — The power radiated by an antenna as if it were isotropic, useful for regulatory and system design comparisons.  
- **Friis Transmission Equation** — A fundamental formula to calculate power received over a radio link, accounting for gains and losses between transmitter and receiver.  
- **Gain (dB)** — A logarithmic measure of gain, expressing the ratio of output power to input power or antenna directivity in decibels.  
- **Half-Power Beamwidth** — The angle between points on an antenna radiation pattern where the power level drops to half (−3 dB) of its maximum.  
- **Noise Figure (NF)** — A measure of degradation of the signal-to-noise ratio caused by components such as amplifiers or antennas.  
- **Noise Temperature** — A measure of the noise power contributed by a component or environment, expressed as an equivalent temperature.  
- **Pulse Repetition Frequency (PRF)** — The rate at which pulse radar transmits pulses, affecting range measurements and ambiguity.  
- **Radiation Efficiency** — The ratio of power radiated by an antenna to the total input power, accounting for losses like absorption or dissipation.  
- **Radar Cross Section (RCS)** — A measure of how detectable an object is by radar, depending on its size, shape, and material.  
- **Sidelobe** — Secondary lobes in an antenna radiation pattern that represent radiated power in undesired directions.  
- **Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)** — The ratio of signal power to noise power, important for determining communication or radar system quality.  
- **Waveguide** — A physical structure guiding electromagnetic waves, often used at microwave frequencies to reduce losses.  
- **Wavelength** — The physical length of one cycle of a wave, inversely proportional to frequency.  
- **Wavelength Dependence (inverse-square law)** — The principle that power density decreases proportionally to the square of the distance from the source.

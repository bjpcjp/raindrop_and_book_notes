- **Attenuation constant (α)** — A measure of how quickly a wave’s amplitude decreases as it propagates through a lossy medium.
- **Brewster angle (θ_B)** — The incidence angle at which reflected light is perfectly polarized parallel to the incident plane, causing zero reflection in parallel polarization.
- **Constitutive relations** — Equations that relate electric and magnetic fields to material properties like permittivity and permeability.
- **Displacement current** — A term introduced by Maxwell representing a time-varying electric field contributing to the magnetic field, enabling electromagnetic wave propagation.
- **Electric wall boundary condition** — A boundary where the tangential electric field is zero, representing a perfect electric conductor surface.
- **Field polarization** — The orientation and behavior of the electric field vector in an electromagnetic wave.
- **Helmholtz equation** — A wave equation derived from Maxwell’s equations describing the spatial variation of electromagnetic fields.
- **Imaginary part of permittivity (ε")** — Represents the dielectric loss in a material due to energy dissipation as heat.
- **Intrinsic impedance (η)** — The ratio of electric field to magnetic field in a plane wave, characteristic of the propagation medium.
- **Loss tangent (tan δ)** — The ratio of the imaginary to real part of permittivity, quantifying dielectric loss.
- **Magnetic wall boundary condition** — A theoretical boundary where the tangential magnetic field is zero, acting like a magnetic conductor.
- **Maxwell’s equations** — Four fundamental equations that govern the behavior of electric and magnetic fields.
- **Poynting vector (S)** — A vector representing the power per unit area flowing in an electromagnetic wave.
- **Phase velocity (u_p)** — The speed at which a point of constant phase travels along the wave.
- **Plane wave** — A wave with electric and magnetic fields uniform in planes perpendicular to the direction of propagation.
- **Propagation constant (γ or k)** — A complex number representing both the phase change and attenuation per unit length of a wave.
- **Reciprocity theorem** — States that interchanging the positions of sources and observation points in an electromagnetic system does not change the response.
- **Reflection coefficient (Γ)** — The ratio of the reflected wave amplitude to the incident wave amplitude at an interface.
- **Skin depth (δ)** — The distance into a conductor at which electromagnetic wave amplitude reduces to 1/e of its surface value.
- **Snell’s law** — Relates the angles of incidence and refraction of a wave crossing an interface between two media.
- **Surface impedance (Z_s)** — The ratio of tangential electric field to tangential magnetic field at the surface of a conductor.
- **Surface resistance (R_s)** — The real part of surface impedance, representing resistive losses on a conductor’s surface.
- **Surface wave** — An electromagnetic wave that propagates along the interface of two media with fields decaying exponentially perpendicular to the interface.
- **Transverse electromagnetic wave (TEM)** — A wave where electric and magnetic fields are perpendicular to each other and to the direction of propagation.
- **Transmission coefficient (T)** — The ratio of transmitted wave amplitude to the incident wave amplitude at an interface.
- **Wave impedance** — Another term for intrinsic impedance; characteristic impedance of a medium for plane waves.
- **Wavelength (λ)** — The spatial distance over which the wave's shape repeats in the direction of propagation.

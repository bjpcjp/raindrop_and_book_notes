- **ABCD matrix** — A matrix representing the voltage-current relationship of a two-port network.
- **Admittance inverter (J inverter)** — A circuit that inverts admittance, used to transform series elements to shunt elements and vice versa.
- **Bloch impedance** — The characteristic impedance of waves propagating on an infinite periodic structure.
- **Branch-line coupler** — A four-port network used for dividing power with specific phase and amplitude characteristics.
- **Chebyshev filter** — A filter with equal-ripple passband characteristics providing a sharper cutoff than maximally flat filters.
- **Coupled microstrip lines** — Two microstrip lines placed close together, allowing electromagnetic coupling used in filter and coupler designs.
- **Coupled resonator filter** — A filter design using a cascade of resonator sections coupled together.
- **Coupled line coupler** — A directional coupler implemented using two closely spaced transmission lines.
- **Coupling factor** — The ratio of power levels between the input and coupled ports in couplers.
- **Cutoff frequency** — The frequency at which a filter begins to attenuate signals.
- **Even and odd mode** — Modes of propagation in coupled lines, where even mode means currents are in phase, odd mode means out of phase.
- **Equal-ripple filter** — A filter design with a ripple of constant amplitude in the passband (Chebyshev response).
- **Filter insertion loss (IL)** — The amount of power loss in a filter's passband.
- **Filter passband** — The frequency range over which a filter allows signals to pass with minimal attenuation.
- **Group velocity** — The velocity at which the envelope of a modulated wave propagates through a medium.
- **Image impedance** — The input impedance seen at one port of a two-port network when the other port is terminated in its corresponding image impedance.
- **Image parameter method** — A traditional method of filter design based on cascading identical two-port sections.
- **Impedance inverter (K inverter)** — A circuit that inverts impedance, used to convert shunt to series elements or vice versa.
- **Kuroda identities** — Four transformations allowing practical implementation of microwave filters by manipulating stubs and sections of transmission lines.
- **Lumped elements** — Circuit components such as inductors and capacitors modeled as discrete elements.
- **Maximally flat filter** — A low-pass filter with no ripples in the passband; also known as Butterworth response.
- **Microstrip** — A planar transmission line used in microwave circuits consisting of a conductor separated from a ground plane by a dielectric substrate.
- **Multisection filter** — A filter composed of multiple reactive elements or coupled sections to achieve steep roll-off and desired characteristics.
- **Periodic structure** — A transmission line or waveguide periodically loaded with reactive elements, exhibiting pass and stop bands.
- **Phase velocity** — The velocity at which a given phase of the wave propagates.
- **Richard's transformation** — A method to replace lumped inductors and capacitors with equivalent transmission line stubs.
- **Scattering matrix (S parameters)** — A matrix representing how microwave signals are transmitted and reflected by a multiport network.
- **Stepped-impedance filter** — A low-pass filter made from alternating sections of high and low characteristic impedance transmission lines.
- **Stopband** — The frequency range over which a filter significantly attenuates signals.
- **Unit element** — A transmission line section of specific length used in Kuroda identities and microwave filter synthesis.
- **Wilkinson power divider** — A power divider that splits signals equally with isolation and matching at all ports.

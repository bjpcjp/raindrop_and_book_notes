- **ABCD parameters** — Matrix parameters describing two-port networks used in circuit analysis and matched conversions.  
- **Attenuation** — Reduction in signal power as it travels through a medium, including both conductor and dielectric losses.  
- **Characteristic impedance** — The inherent impedance of a transmission line when infinitely long, affecting signal reflection and transmission.  
- **Circulator** — A non-reciprocal device that routes signals sequentially between ports, commonly used with ferrite materials.  
- **Coaxial line** — A type of transmission line with a central conductor surrounded by a cylindrical shield, used for RF signals.  
- **Coupled lines** — Transmission lines placed close to each other to allow energy transfer, used in filters and couplers.  
- **Cutoff frequency** — The minimum frequency at which a specific waveguide mode can propagate.  
- **Dielectric constant** — Material property denoting the permittivity relative to vacuum, influencing wave propagation.  
- **Dielectric loss** — Power loss in a dielectric material due to its non-ideal insulating properties.  
- **Directional coupler** — A device that samples a small amount of power from a transmission line in a specific direction.  
- **Electric field** — A field around charged particles or in electromagnetic waves representing force per charge unit.  
- **Ferrite** — A magnetic material used in microwave devices for non-reciprocal effects like isolation and circulation.  
- **Filters** — Circuits that pass signals within certain frequency ranges while attenuating others, e.g., bandpass or lowpass.  
- **Impedance matching** — Process of making load impedance equal to source or line impedance to maximize power transfer.  
- **Insertion loss** — The loss of signal power caused by inserting a device into a transmission line.  
- **Microstrip** — A planar transmission line consisting of a conductor separated from ground by a dielectric substrate.  
- **Noise figure** — A measure of degradation of the signal-to-noise ratio by components or systems.  
- **Oscillator** — A device that generates a periodic signal at a specific frequency, often using resonators or negative resistance devices.  
- **Phase velocity** — The speed at which a single frequency component of a wave propagates through a medium.  
- **Power gain** — The ratio of output power to input power of an amplifier or device.  
- **Propagation constant** — A complex number describing attenuation and phase shift per unit length of a transmission line.  
- **Quarter-wave transformer** — A transmission line section of length λ/4 used to match impedances between mismatched lines.  
- **Return loss** — A measure of signal reflection caused by impedance mismatches, expressed in decibels.  
- **Scattering matrix (S-matrix)** — Mathematical representation of how RF signals behave at multi-port network junctions.  
- **Stripline** — A transmission line embedded between two ground planes in a dielectric substrate for controlled impedance.  
- **Transmission line** — A physical structure transmitting electrical signals with specific characteristic impedance and losses.  
- **Waveguide** — A hollow metallic structure guiding electromagnetic waves, often at microwave frequencies.  
- **Zeroes of Bessel functions** — Values where Bessel functions equal zero, relevant in waveguide and cavity mode calculations.

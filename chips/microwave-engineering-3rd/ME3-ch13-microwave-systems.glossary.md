- **Antenna Gain** — The product of an antenna's directivity and efficiency, representing the effective power amplification in a given direction.
- **Antenna Noise Temperature** — Equivalent noise temperature representing thermal noise generated internally and external noise received by the antenna.
- **Aperture Antenna** — Antennas such as horns, reflectors, or lenses that radiate energy through a defined physical aperture.
- **Aperture Efficiency** — The ratio of an antenna's actual directivity to the maximum directivity possible for its physical aperture.
- **Background Noise Temperature** — The equivalent temperature of noise power received from the environment by an antenna.
- **Beamwidth** — Angular width of an antenna’s main radiation lobe where power drops to half (3 dB down) of its maximum.
- **Brightnesstemperature** — A measure of radiation intensity converted to an equivalent temperature indicating the effective temperature of a radiating source.
- **Conversion Loss** — The loss in signal power when a mixer converts an RF signal to an IF signal.
- **Directivity** — The measure of how focused an antenna’s radiation pattern is in a specific direction compared to an isotropic radiator.
- **Dicke Radiometer** — A radiometer design that rapidly switches between antenna and a reference noise source to reduce gain variation errors.
- **Effective Aperture Area** — The effective cross-sectional area that an antenna presents to incoming electromagnetic waves.
- **EIRP (Effective Isotropic Radiated Power)** — The product of transmitted power and antenna gain, representing power radiated in the strongest direction as if from an isotropic source.
- **Far-Field Distance** — The minimum distance from an antenna where the radiated waves can be approximated as planar instead of spherical.
- **Friis Transmission Formula** — Calculates received power over a wireless link based on transmit power, antenna gains, distance, and wavelength.
- **Image Frequency** — An unwanted frequency that can produce a response in a mixer, causing interference in receiver circuits.
- **Local Oscillator (LO)** — A signal source used in mixers to convert frequencies in radio receivers or transmitters.
- **Manley-Rowe Relations** — Conservation laws that relate power at various frequencies in a nonlinear mixer.
- **Mixer** — A nonlinear component that combines two input signals to produce sum and difference output frequencies.
- **Noise Figure** — A measure of degradation of the signal-to-noise ratio caused by components in a radio receiver.
- **Passband** — The frequency range of a filter or circuit over which it passes signals with minimal attenuation.
- **Phase Noise** — Short-term random fluctuations in the phase of a signal, often arising in oscillators.
- **Radiation Efficiency** — The ratio of power radiated by an antenna to the power input to the antenna, accounting for losses.
- **Radar Cross Section** — A measure of how detectable an object is by radar, representing the equivalent area that scatters power back to the radar.
- **Radiometer** — A passive microwave receiver designed to measure the intensity of thermal radiation from a source.
- **Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)** — The ratio of signal power to noise power, indicating signal quality.
- **Smith Chart** — A graphical aid for solving problems involving transmission lines and impedance matching.
- **Subharmonic Mixer** — A mixer that uses a harmonic of the local oscillator frequency to allow mixing at a fraction of the fundamental frequency.
- **Superheterodyne Receiver** — A receiver architecture that converts RF signals to a fixed intermediate frequency for easier filtering and amplification.
- **Tuned Radio Frequency (TRF) Receiver** — An early receiver design using multiple tunable RF amplifiers without frequency conversion.
- **Transmission Line Loss** — The attenuation of signal power as it passes through a transmission line.
- **Voltage Standing Wave Ratio (VSWR)** — A measure of impedance matching on a transmission line, indicating reflected power.
- **Waveguide** — A physical structure that guides electromagnetic waves from one point to another.
- **Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs)** — Short-range wireless communication systems connecting devices within a small area.

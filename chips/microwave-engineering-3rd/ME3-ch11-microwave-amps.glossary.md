- **Bandwidth** — The range of frequencies over which an amplifier or filter operates effectively.  
- **Balanced Amplifier** — An amplifier design using two amplifiers and hybrid couplers to improve bandwidth and input/output matching.  
- **Class A Amplifier** — A power amplifier biased to conduct over the entire input signal cycle, offering high linearity but ~50% efficiency.  
- **Class B Amplifier** — A power amplifier where the transistor conducts during half of the input cycle, often used in push-pull configurations for ~78% efficiency.  
- **Compression Point (1 dB)** — The input power level at which the gain of an amplifier falls by 1 dB from its small-signal gain, indicating onset of nonlinearity.  
- **Conjugate Matching** — Impedance matching where the source or load impedance is the complex conjugate of the device input or output impedance, maximizing power transfer.  
- **Distributed Amplifier** — A broadband amplifier using multiple transistors along transmission lines to achieve wide bandwidth and moderate gain.  
- **Equivalent Circuit Model** — A circuit representation of a transistor using lumped elements to capture behavior including noise and nonlinearities.  
- **Gain (Power Gain)** — The ratio of output power to input power for an amplifier.  
- **Gain Compression** — The reduction of amplifier gain due to nonlinear effects at high input power levels.  
- **Large-Signal S Parameters** — S parameters measured at high input power levels where device behavior deviates from linearity.  
- **Load-Pull Contours** — Smith chart plots showing output power levels as a function of load impedance, used to optimize power amplifier design.  
- **Matching Network** — A circuit used to transform impedances for maximal power transfer and/or minimal reflection.  
- **Maximum Stable Gain (MSG)** — The highest gain achievable without causing amplifier instability, assuming a fixed source/load impedance.  
- **Maximum Transducer Gain** — The highest achievable power gain assuming conjugate matching of both source and load.  
- **Microwave Amplifier** — An amplifier operating at microwave frequencies (typically above 1 GHz).  
- **Noise Figure (NF)** — A measure of how much an amplifier degrades the signal-to-noise ratio of the input signal.  
- **Optimal Source Reflection Coefficient (fopt)** — The source impedance reflection coefficient that yields minimum noise figure for a transistor amplifier.  
- **Power Added Efficiency (PAE)** — A measure of power amplifier efficiency considering both output and input RF power.  
- **Power Divider** — A device that splits input power into two or more outputs, used in balanced amplifiers and other RF circuits.  
- **Reflection Coefficient (f)** — A complex ratio describing reflected to incident wave amplitudes at a port, related to impedance mismatch.  
- **Rollet’s Stability Factor (K)** — A parameter calculated from S parameters that indicates whether a two-port network is unconditionally stable.  
- **Small-Signal S Parameters** — The S parameters measured under low input power conditions assuming linear device behavior.  
- **Stability Circles** — Loci on the Smith chart representing the boundaries between stable and potentially unstable source or load reflection coefficients.  
- **Transducer Power Gain** — The ratio of power delivered to the load to power available from the source, accounting for source and load mismatch.  
- **Unilateral Approximation** — Assuming negligible feedback S parameter (S12≈0) to simplify amplifier analysis.  
- **Unconditional Stability** — A condition in which an amplifier is stable for all passive source and load impedances (|fin| < 1 and |fout| < 1 for all).

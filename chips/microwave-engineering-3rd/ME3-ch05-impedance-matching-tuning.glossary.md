- **ABCD parameters** — A set of four parameters used to describe the behavior of two-port networks in terms of input and output voltages and currents.
- **Admittance matrix** — A matrix describing a multi-port network using admittances (inverse of impedances) between ports.
- **Bode-Fano criterion** — A theoretical limit that defines the trade-off between bandwidth and reflection coefficient in a passive, lossless impedance matching network.
- **Characteristic impedance (Zo)** — The impedance of a transmission line or waveguide that allows signal propagation without reflections.
- **Chebyshev transformer** — A multisection matching transformer designed to have equal ripple in the passband, optimizing bandwidth at the cost of ripple.
- **Current loop** — A small loop of current used as a source to excite specific modes inside waveguides.
- **Cr reactance (X)** — The imaginary part of an impedance representing reactive elements such as inductors or capacitors.
- **Four-port 90° hybrid coupler** — A microwave device with four ports that splits power with a 90-degree phase difference between outputs.
- **Fringing capacitance** — Parasitic capacitance at the open end of microstrip lines due to the spreading of electric fields.
- **Impedance matrix (Z-matrix)** — A matrix representation of a multi-port network relating voltages and currents at ports via impedances.
- **Impedance matching** — The process of making the load impedance equal to the source or line impedance to minimize reflections and maximize power transfer.
- **L-section matching network** — A simple two-reactive-element impedance matching circuit configured in an ‘L’ shape.
- **Load admittance (Y)** — The inverse of load impedance, representing how easily a load allows current to flow.
- **Multisection transformer** — A matching transformer composed of multiple transmission line sections with different impedances for broadband matching.
- **Quarter-wave transformer** — A transmission line section one-quarter wavelength long used to match two different impedances at a specific frequency.
- **Reflection coefficient (Γ)** — The ratio of reflected wave amplitude to incident wave amplitude at a discontinuity or load.
- **Series stub** — A length of transmission line connected in series, used as a reactive element for impedance matching.
- **Shunt stub** — A length of transmission line connected in parallel (shunt) as a reactive element for impedance matching.
- **Smith chart** — A graphical tool used for solving problems involving transmission lines and matching circuits.
- **Small reflections theory** — An approximate method for analyzing multiple small reflections in cascaded discontinuities.
- **S-parameters (scattering parameters)** — Parameters describing the reflection and transmission of waves in RF networks.
- **Tapered line** — A transmission line whose characteristic impedance varies gradually along its length, used for broadband impedance matching.
- **Taylor distribution** — A method for specifying antenna array illumination or impedance tapering to control sidelobe levels.
- **Transmission line stub** — A short section of transmission line used as an inductive or capacitive element in impedance matching.
- **Two-port network** — An electrical network or device with two pairs of terminals for input and output.
- **Waveguide mode (TE10, TE11, etc.)** — Specific patterns of electromagnetic field distribution propagating through a waveguide.

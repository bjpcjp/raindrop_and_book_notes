- **Admittance (Y)** — A measure of how easily a circuit allows current to flow, the inverse of impedance.
- **Attenuation Constant (α)** — A parameter indicating how much a wave amplitude decreases per unit length on a transmission line.
- **Characteristic Impedance (Z₀)** — A constant impedance that relates voltage and current in a traveling wave along a transmission line.
- **Conjugate Matching** — The condition where the load impedance is the complex conjugate of the source impedance to maximize power transfer.
- **Dielectric Loss (G)** — The loss of power due to the dielectric material between conductors, represented as shunt conductance.
- **Distortionless Line** — A transmission line where the phase constant is a linear function of frequency, resulting in no signal distortion.
- **Distributed-Parameter Network** — A network model where voltage and current vary continuously along the length of a transmission line.
- **Equivalent Circuit Model** — A lumped-element representation of a transmission line segment characterized by per unit length R, L, G, C.
- **Field Analysis** — A method of deriving transmission line parameters and behavior from electromagnetic field equations.
- **Forward Wave** — The wave component traveling in the positive z-direction on a transmission line.
- **Frequency (f)** — The number of oscillations per second of a wave, measured in hertz (Hz).
- **Inductance per Unit Length (L)** — Represents the magnetic energy storage in the transmission line conductors per meter length.
- **Load Impedance (Z_L)** — The complex impedance connected at the end of a transmission line.

- **Normalized Impedance (z)** — The ratio of the actual impedance to the characteristic impedance, used in Smith chart analysis.
- **Phase Constant (β)** — The spatial rate of change of the phase of a wave traveling along a transmission line.
- **Phase Velocity (v_p)** — The speed at which a wave phase propagates along the transmission line.
- **Poynting Vector** — A vector describing the directional energy flux (power flow) of an electromagnetic wave.
- **Reflection Coefficient (Γ or f)** — The ratio of reflected to incident voltage wave amplitudes at a discontinuity in a transmission line.
- **Return Loss (RL)** — A measure in dB of how much power is reflected by impedance mismatch, related to the reflection coefficient.
- **Standing Wave Ratio (SWR)** — A measure of voltage variations due to reflections along a transmission line; ratio of max to min voltage.
- **Surface Resistance (R_s)** — The effective resistance per unit area of conductor surfaces due to skin effect.
- **Surface Roughness** — The physical irregularity on conductor surfaces that increases losses beyond ideal smooth conductor losses.
- **Telegrapher’s Equations** — Differential equations governing voltage and current on a transmission line.
- **Transmission Coefficient (T)** — The ratio of transmitted to incident wave amplitudes across an impedance discontinuity.

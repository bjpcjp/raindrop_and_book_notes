- **Admittance Inverter** — A network element that inverts the admittance of a circuit section, often realized by specific transmission line segments.  
- **Birefringence** — The property where a material has different propagation constants for different orthogonal polarizations of waves.  
- **Circular Polarization** — A wave polarization where the electric (or magnetic) field vector rotates in a circle as the wave propagates.  
- **Curie Temperature** — The temperature above which a ferrimagnetic material loses its net magnetization.  
- **Demagnetization Factor** — A geometric factor that relates the internal magnetic field in a ferrite to the externally applied bias field, depending on the shape of the sample.  
- **Ferromagnetic Material** — A material like iron or steel with permanent magnetic properties due to electron spin alignment.  
- **Ferrimagnetic Material** — A magnetic material with anisotropic properties and high resistivity, often used at microwave frequencies (e.g., yttrium iron garnet).  
- **Ferrite** — A type of ferrimagnetic ceramic often used in microwave devices for nonreciprocal behavior.  
- **Faraday Rotation** — The rotation of the polarization plane of a linearly polarized wave as it propagates through a biased ferrite medium.  
- **Gyrator** — A two-port nonreciprocal device that introduces a 180° differential phase shift between its ports.  
- **Gyromagnetic Resonance** — The resonant condition where the forced precession frequency of magnetic dipoles equals their natural precession frequency, leading to strong absorption.  
- **Image Impedance** — The impedance that a network “looks like” when viewed from one port, used in filter design.  
- **Isolator** — A two-port device allowing transmission in one direction while providing high attenuation in the reverse direction.  
- **Larmor Frequency** — The precession frequency of magnetic dipoles under a DC bias magnetic field.  
- **Linewidth (ΔH)** — The width of the resonance peak in a ferrite’s magnetic susceptibility, reflecting magnetic loss.  
- **Maximally Flat Filter** — A filter design that has a flat passband with no ripples and a smooth frequency response.  
- **Nonreciprocal Component** — A device whose transmission characteristics differ depending on the direction of signal flow.  
- **Phase Shifter** — A component that changes the phase of a microwave signal, often controlled by magnetic bias in ferrites.  
- **Precession** — The rotation of magnetic dipoles around an applied bias magnetic field.  
- **Propagation Constant** — A complex quantity expressing both phase change and attenuation per unit length of waveguide or transmission line.  
- **Quarter-Wave Stub Resonator** — A transmission line stub of quarter-wavelength electrical length used in bandpass and bandstop filter design.  
- **Reciprocal Component** — A device whose transmission is the same in both directions.  
- **Resonance Isolator** — An isolator operating near the gyromagnetic resonance of a ferrite, employing strong magnetic losses for isolation.  
- **Saturation Magnetization (Ms)** — The maximum magnetization a ferrite material can attain under an applied field.  
- **Stepped-Impedance Filter** — A filter implemented by cascading transmission line sections with differing characteristic impedances.  
- **Stub Filter** — A filter made using short-circuited or open-circuited transmission line stubs.  
- **Synchronous Rotation** — Circular polarization synchronized with the precession frequency of magnetic dipoles.  
- **Transmission Matrix (ABCD Matrix)** — A matrix describing the input-output voltage and current relationships of a two-port network.  
- **Yttrium Iron Garnet (YIG)** — A ferrimagnetic material widely used in microwave devices for nonreciprocal behavior.

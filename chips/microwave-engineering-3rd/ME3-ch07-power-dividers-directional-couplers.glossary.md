- **Broadside-coupled line** — Coupled transmission lines stacked vertically, typically in stripline, with one conductor above the other.  
- **Capacitance per unit length (C)** — Electrical capacitance distributed along the length of a transmission line.  
- **Chebyshev response** — A frequency response with equal ripple behavior in the passband, often used in filter and coupler design.  
- **Circulator** — A nonreciprocal three-port device that routes signals sequentially from one port to the next.  
- **Coupling factor (C)** — The fraction or ratio of power transferred from input to coupled port in a coupler, usually expressed in dB.  
- **Coupled transmission lines** — Two or more transmission lines placed close enough to enable electromagnetic coupling between them.  
- **Directional coupler** — A four-port device that couples a specific proportion of power from one transmission line to another while isolating ports.  
- **Directivity (D)** — The ability of a coupler to distinguish between forward and reverse traveling waves; ratio of coupled to isolated power in dB.  
- **Fabry-Perot resonator** — A cavity resonator formed by two parallel reflecting surfaces producing resonance at discrete frequencies.  
- **Even mode** — A mode of coupled lines where currents and voltages on adjacent conductors are equal in amplitude and phase.  
- **E-plane T-junction** — A waveguide power divider implemented by splitting along the electric field plane.  
- **Lange coupler** — A highly coupled directional coupler formed by multiple parallel lines interdigitated and connected by bond wires.  
- **Magic-T** — A four-port waveguide hybrid junction providing 0° and 180° output phases, also known as a 180° hybrid.  
- **Microstrip line** — A planar transmission line fabricated on a dielectric substrate with a conducting ground plane underneath.  
- **Multihole waveguide coupler** — A directional coupler using multiple small apertures in a common wall to enhance bandwidth and directivity.  
- **Odd mode** — A mode of coupled lines where currents and voltages on adjacent conductors are equal in magnitude but opposite in phase.  
- **Power divider (T-junction)** — A network that divides an input signal into two or more output signals, typically three-port.  
- **Quadrature hybrid** — A 3 dB coupler providing outputs with a 90° phase difference, commonly implemented as branch-line couplers.  
- **Resistive power divider** — A three-port power divider employing resistors to achieve matched ports with inherent losses.  
- **Return loss (S11)** — A measure of reflected power at a port, indicative of how well the port is matched.  
- **Ring hybrid (rat-race)** — A planar 180° hybrid coupler consisting of a ring-shaped transmission line providing sum and difference outputs.  
- **Scattering matrix ([S])** — A matrix describing power reflection and transmission coefficients between ports of a microwave network.  
- **Slotline coupler** — A planar directional coupler made by slots etched in a conductor plane, not explicitly discussed but implied in coupled line context.  
- **Through port** — In a coupler, the port that passes most of the input power to the output with minimal coupling.  
- **T-junction** — A three-port junction used as a power divider or combiner with typically no isolation between output ports.  
- **Transmission line characteristic impedance (Z0)** — The impedance that determines how signals propagate along a transmission line without reflections.  
- **Wilkinson power divider** — A lossless three-port power divider with isolation between output ports and matched ports, employing quarter-wave transformers and resistors.  
- **Waveguide coupler** — A directional coupler implemented using apertures or slots between adjoining waveguides.

- **Aperture coupling** — A method of coupling energy into a cavity resonator through a small opening in its wall.
- **Attenuation constant (α)** — A parameter that measures signal loss per unit length in a transmission line.
- **Bandwidth (BW)** — The range of frequencies over which the resonator or matching network operates effectively.
- **Bode-Fano criterion** — A theoretical limit describing the trade-off between bandwidth and reflection coefficient in impedance matching.
- **Capacitive coupling** — Coupling via a small capacitor, often used in microstrip gap-coupled resonators.
- **Characteristic impedance (Z₀)** — The impedance that a transmission line would have if it were infinitely long and lossless.
- **Chebyshev matching transformer** — A matching network designed to approximate an ideal passband using a ripple response.
- **Complex resonant frequency** — A resonant frequency extended into the complex plane to include loss effects via an imaginary component.
- **Critical coupling** — The condition where a resonator is matched to a feedline for maximum power transfer, with external and unloaded Q equal.
- **Dielectric constant (εr)** — The relative permittivity of a material compared to vacuum, affecting wave propagation and resonances.
- **Dielectric loss tangent (tan δ)** — A measure of the energy loss in a dielectric material due to polarization mechanisms.
- **Dielectric resonator** — A resonator made of high-permittivity dielectric material, confining electromagnetic fields mostly inside the dielectric.
- **External Q (Q_ext)** — The quality factor associated with energy loss from coupling to external circuits or loads.
- **Harmonic modes** — Resonant frequencies that are integer multiples of the fundamental resonance.
- **Impedance inverter** — A network element that transforms a series element’s impedance to a parallel admittance or vice versa.
- **Loaded Q (Q_L)** — The quality factor of a resonator including external loading effects.
- **Loss tangent** — A parameter quantifying the dielectric losses in a material.
- **Matching network** — A circuit designed to minimize reflection and maximize power transfer between stages.
- **Parallel resonant circuit** — A resonant circuit composed of reactive elements connected in parallel, having high impedance at resonance.
- **Passband reflection coefficient** — The magnitude of the reflection coefficient within the designed frequency band.
- **Perturbational method** — An approximate technique to find how small changes in cavity shape or material affect resonant frequencies and Q.
- **Quarter-wave transformer** — A transmission line segment one-quarter wavelength long used to match impedances.
- **Quality factor (Q)** — A measure of how underdamped a resonator is, indicating bandwidth relative to center frequency.
- **Reflection coefficient (Γ)** — A measure of the portion of an electromagnetic wave reflected by an impedance discontinuity.
- **Resonant frequency (f₀)** — The frequency at which a resonator stores and exchanges energy between electric and magnetic fields.
- **Return loss (RL)** — A measure in dB of power lost due to reflection at an input port.
- **Short-circuited stub** — A transmission line section terminated in a short circuit, used for tuning and matching.
- **Series resonant circuit** — A resonant circuit composed of reactive elements connected in series, having low impedance at resonance.
- **Shunt-stub tuner** — A matching device consisting of a stub connected in parallel to a transmission line.
- **Smith chart** — A graphical aid for solving problems with transmission lines and matching circuits.
- **Surface resistivity (R_s)** — The effective resistance due to conductor losses at the surface of conductors at high frequencies.
- **Transmission line resonator** — A resonator formed from a length of transmission line terminated by specific impedances.
- **Unloaded Q (Q₀)** — The intrinsic quality factor of a resonator without external loading.
- **Waveguide cavity** — A resonator formed by a section of waveguide closed at both ends.

- **ABCD matrix** — A 2x2 transmission matrix describing voltage and current relations in a two-port network, enabling easy cascading of multiple networks.  
- **Admittance matrix [Y]** — A matrix relating port currents to voltages for an N-port network, inverse of the impedance matrix.  
- **Characteristic impedance (Z₀)** — The ratio of voltage to current for a traveling wave on a transmission line, defining its intrinsic impedance.  
- **Coupling** — The transfer of energy between different transmission lines or waveguides, often at discontinuities or junctions.  
- **Dielectric constant (εᵣ)** — A material parameter that affects the propagation velocity and impedance of waves in a dielectric medium.  
- **Discontinuity** — A sudden change in transmission line or waveguide geometry causing reflection and mode conversion.  
- **Evanescent mode** — A non-propagating wave mode that decays exponentially with distance, storing reactive power near discontinuities.  
- **Field analysis** — The rigorous solution of Maxwell’s equations to find electromagnetic fields throughout space.  
- **Finite conductivity loss** — Attenuation in waveguides due to imperfect electrical conductivity of walls.  
- **Guide wavelength (λ_g)** — The wavelength of a propagating mode within a waveguide, generally different from free space wavelength.  
- **Impedance matrix [Z]** — A matrix relating port voltages to currents for an N-port network, contains transfer and input impedances.  
- **Incident wave (a⁺)** — The forward-traveling wave arriving at a port in a transmission line or waveguide.  
- **Modal analysis** — A method to solve waveguide discontinuity problems by expanding fields into known waveguide modes and matching boundary conditions.  
- **Mode** — A particular field distribution pattern of electromagnetic waves that can propagate in a waveguide.  
- **Propagation constant (β)** — The phase constant of a propagating mode, relating to wave phase change per unit length.  
- **Reflection coefficient (Γ)** — The ratio of the amplitude of the reflected wave to the incident wave at a discontinuity or load.  
- **Scattering matrix [S]** — A matrix relating incident to reflected voltage waves at each port of an N-port network, commonly measured in microwave networks.  
- **Self-loop (in flow graph)** — A branch in a signal flow graph starting and ending at the same node, representing feedback or reflection.  
- **Signal flow graph** — A graphical representation of a microwave network showing node voltages and wave transmissions via branches labeled by scattering parameters.  
- **Surface current density (Jₛ or Mₛ)** — An idealized electric or magnetic current sheet that can excite particular waveguide modes.  
- **TEM mode** — Transverse electromagnetic mode with both electric and magnetic fields transverse to the direction of propagation, supporting unique voltage/current definitions.  
- **Transmission line** — A structure guiding electromagnetic waves, characterized by distributed impedance and admittance per unit length.  
- **Transmission matrix** — See ABCD matrix.  
- **Wave impedance (Z_w)** — The characteristic impedance of a particular mode in a transmission line or waveguide, dependent on mode type (TE, TM, TEM).  
- **Waveguide mode** — A stable field pattern that satisfies boundary conditions and Maxwell’s equations inside a waveguide.  
- **Waveguide discontinuity equivalent circuit** — A lumped-circuit representation of a discontinuity, used to model its effect on wave propagation.

- **Attenuation constant** — A parameter representing the loss per unit length of a transmission line or waveguide.
- **Characteristic impedance (Z₀)** — The ratio of voltage to current of a traveling wave on a transmission line, dependent on line geometry and materials.
- **Cutoff frequency** — The lowest frequency at which a particular mode of a waveguide can propagate.
- **Dielectric loss** — Energy loss in a transmission line caused by the dielectric material's imperfect insulation.
- **Dielectric constant (εᵣ)** — Relative permittivity of a material, affecting wave propagation speed and impedance.
- **Evanescent mode** — A mode below its cutoff frequency where fields decay exponentially and do not propagate.
- **Field components (E, H)** — Electric (E) and magnetic (H) fields, described by transverse and longitudinal parts in wave propagation.
- **Grounded dielectric slab** — A dielectric layer backed by a conducting ground plane supporting surface wave propagation.
- **Helmholtz wave equation** — A differential equation describing the spatial variation of electromagnetic fields in a waveguide.
- **Modal analysis** — The study of different propagating modes (TEM, TE, TM) in waveguides and transmission lines.
- **Parallel plate waveguide** — A transmission line consisting of two parallel conductive plates supporting TEM and higher-order modes.
- **Phase velocity (vₚ)** — The rate at which the phase of the wave propagates along the waveguide.
- **Propagation constant (β)** — A complex value describing phase change and attenuation per unit length along a transmission line.
- **Reflection coefficient (Γ)** — The ratio of the reflected wave amplitude to the incident wave amplitude at a discontinuity.
- **Return loss (R_L)** — A measure in decibels of the portion of power reflected back due to impedance mismatch.
- **Surface wave** — An electromagnetic wave that travels along the interface of different media, decaying exponentially away from the interface.
- **SWR (Standing Wave Ratio)** — A measure of impedance matching in a transmission line, defined as the ratio of maximum to minimum voltage.
- **TE mode (Transverse Electric)** — A mode where the electric field has no longitudinal component along the direction of propagation.
- **TEM mode (Transverse Electromagnetic)** — A mode with no electric or magnetic field components in the direction of propagation; voltage and current waves exist.
- **TM mode (Transverse Magnetic)** — A mode where the magnetic field has no longitudinal component along the direction of propagation.
- **Transmission line** — A structure guiding electromagnetic waves, characterized by its impedance and propagation constant.
- **Wave impedance (Z)** — Ratio of transverse electric to magnetic fields in a propagating mode; dependent on the mode and medium.
- **Waveguide** — A structure that guides waves, typically supporting TE and TM modes with cutoff frequencies.
- **Wavenumber (k)** — The spatial frequency of a wave, related to wavelength and propagation constant.

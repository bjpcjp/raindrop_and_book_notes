- **Add/Drop Multiplexer (OADM)** — A device that adds or removes specific WDM channels from a fiber without affecting others.  
- **Amplified Spontaneous Emission (ASE)** — Noise generated by optical amplifiers that degrades signal quality over distance.  
- **Arrayed Waveguide Grating (AWG)** — A passive optical filter used for high channel counts in WDM systems.  
- **Attenuation** — The reduction of optical signal strength as light travels through fiber.  
- **Bend Insensitive Fiber** — Fiber designed to minimize signal loss when bent or curved.  
- **Chromatic Dispersion (CMD)** — Spreading of different light wavelengths that causes signal distortion.  
- **Coarse Wave Division Multiplexing (CWDM)** — A WDM technique with fewer, widely spaced channels using cheaper lasers.  
- **Decibel (dB)** — A logarithmic unit measuring ratios of power or intensity in optical signals.  
- **dBm** — An absolute optical power measurement referenced to 1 milliwatt.  
- **Differential Group Delay (DGD)** — Time difference in arrival between polarizations causing dispersion in fiber.  
- **Dispersion** — The spreading of optical signals in fiber that degrades clarity at the receiver.  
- **Dense Wave Division Multiplexing (DWDM)** — A WDM technique with many tightly spaced channels for high capacity.  
- **EDFA (Erbium Doped Fiber Amplifier)** — An optical amplifier using erbium-doped fiber to boost 1550nm signals.  
- **Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG)** — A reflective filter created by etching the fiber core to select specific wavelengths.  
- **Index of Refraction** — A material’s ratio of light speed compared to vacuum, affecting light propagation.  
- **Laser Optimized Multi-Mode Fiber (OM3/OM4)** — Multi-mode fiber designed for longer distances with laser sources.  
- **Loss** — The decrease in optical power due to absorption, scattering, or bending.  
- **Modal Dispersion** — Signal spreading caused by multiple light paths in multi-mode fiber.  
- **Multi-Mode Fiber (MMF)** — Fiber with a large core supporting multiple light modes for short distances.  
- **Optical Amplifier** — Device that increases light signal strength without converting to electrical form.  
- **Optical Power** — The intensity or brightness of the light signal traveling through fiber.  
- **Optical Signal to Noise Ratio (OSNR)** — Ratio of signal strength to noise, crucial for transmission quality.  
- **Polarization Mode Dispersion (PMD)** — Dispersion caused by different speeds of light polarizations in imperfect fiber.  
- **Refractive Index** — See Index of Refraction.  
- **Raman Amplification** — Distributed optical amplification using stimulated Raman scattering over long fiber spans.  
- **Reconfigurable Optical Add/Drop Multiplexer (ROADM)** — A software-controlled OADM allowing flexible channel routing.  
- **Single Mode Fiber (SMF)** — Fiber with a very small core for long-distance, high-bandwidth transmission.  
- **Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM)** — Combining multiple light wavelengths on one fiber to increase capacity.

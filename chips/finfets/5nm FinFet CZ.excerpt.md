This paper presents a design flow for creating a Liberty-format 5nm FinFET standard cell library that supports near-threshold and super-threshold voltage regimes, demonstrating up to 40X circuit speed improvement and three orders of magnitude energy reduction compared to 45nm bulk CMOS technology. The library enables static timing analysis, circuit synthesis, and dynamic voltage and frequency scaling, with characterized timing, power, and capacitance parameters validated through benchmark circuit synthesis results.

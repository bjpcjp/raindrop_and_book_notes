This paper presents the development and characterization of 7nm FinFET standard cell libraries supporting multiple threshold and supply voltages, demonstrating significant energy efficiency and performance improvements over 14nm and 45nm bulk CMOS technologies. Circuit synthesis results show 10X to 1000X energy reductions in the super-threshold regime and up to 3000X reductions in the near-threshold regime, highlighting the promise of 7nm FinFET technology for advanced low-power VLSI design.

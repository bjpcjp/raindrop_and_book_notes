Clock tree synthesis (CTS) is critical for ASIC and SoC design robustness, requiring careful consideration of parameters like latency, skew, duty cycle, uncommon path, signal integrity, and power dissipation, especially as designs grow more complex with multiple clock sources and modes. The article illustrates through case studies how conventional EDA tools may fall short in complex scenarios, emphasizing the need for designers to understand clock architecture intricacies to guide tool implementation and optimize clock tree quality.

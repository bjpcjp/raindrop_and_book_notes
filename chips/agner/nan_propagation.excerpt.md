This document compares methods for detecting numerical errors in floating point calculations, emphasizing that relying on the propagation of INF and NAN values offers superior performance and compatibility with modern SIMD vectorization compared to fault trapping and errno. It also highlights specific exceptions to INF/NAN propagation, issues with comparisons involving NANs, and the utility of NAN payloads for diagnostic information.

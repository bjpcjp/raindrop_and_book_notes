This manual from Agner Fog provides detailed tables of instruction latencies, throughputs, and micro-operation breakdowns for Intel, AMD, and VIA x86-family microprocessors based on experimental measurements. It explains the methodology, definitions, and specific characteristics of various instructions across multiple CPU microarchitectures to aid software and compiler optimization.

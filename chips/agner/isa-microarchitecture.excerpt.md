The Intel Pentium 4 (P4) and P4E processors use a trace cache that stores decoded micro-operations (µops) instead of raw instruction opcodes, allowing the processor to overcome the decoding bottleneck characteristic of previous designs. Each µop entry in the trace cache requires 53 to 64 bits depending on the processor variant, with complex µops possibly occupying multiple entries through borrowing storage space from simpler adjacent µops, and this design enables efficient handling of instructions, immediate data, and memory operands within the limitations of the trace cache architecture.

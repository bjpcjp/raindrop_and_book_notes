This manual, "Optimizing Subroutines in Assembly Language" by Agner Fog, provides an in-depth guide to writing and optimizing assembly code for x86 platforms, focusing on speed-critical coding techniques, proper integration with high-level languages, and adherence to ABI standards and calling conventions. It covers essential topics such as register usage, addressing modes, assembly programming methods (intrinsic functions, inline assembly, and assemblers), and practical considerations for creating thread-safe, portable, and efficient assembly routines.

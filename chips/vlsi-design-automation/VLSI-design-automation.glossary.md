- **ASIC (Application Specific Integrated Circuit)** — A custom chip designed for a particular application, often using semi-custom or standard cell design styles.  
- **Behavioral Design** — High-level system description focusing on input, output, and timing without implementation details.  
- **CAD (Computer Aided Design)** — Software tools used to assist with the design and verification of VLSI circuits.  
- **Channel Routing** — A detailed routing process that completes connections within a defined channel between blocks or cells.  
- **Circuit Extraction** — The process of deriving a circuit representation from a layout for verification and timing analysis.  
- **Compaction** — Technique to reduce the layout area of a chip to minimize wire lengths and improve performance.  
- **Design Rule Checking (DRC)** — Verification step ensuring the layout conforms to fabrication process constraints.  
- **Die** — The individual rectangular piece of silicon on which a chip is fabricated.  
- **Feedthrough** — Empty space between cells in a standard cell design allowing wiring to pass through.  
- **Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA)** — A programmable chip often discussed in VLSI design but not detailed in this segment.  
- **Floorplanning** — Step in physical design where block shapes and relative positions are determined.  
- **Full-Custom Design** — A design style allowing blocks to be placed anywhere with no layout constraints, used for high-performance chips.  
- **Global Routing** — High-level routing that defines general paths for connections before detailed geometric routing.  
- **I/O Pads** — Areas around the chip periphery used to connect external signals to internal circuits.  
- **Layout** — Geometric representation of a circuit using polygons and lines arranged in multiple layers.  
- **Layout Versus Schematic (LVS)** — Verification that the physical layout matches the circuit schematic.  
- **Logic Design** — Derivation and testing of control flow and logic operations typically expressed in RTL or HDL.  
- **Logic Synthesis** — Automated process converting HDL descriptions into gate-level netlists or layout using standard cells.  
- **Netlist** — A circuit description showing components and their interconnections.  
- **Non-adjacent Cell Routing** — Routing between cells that are not placed in adjacent rows, often requiring feedthroughs.  
- **Partitioning** — Dividing a large circuit into smaller blocks or sub-circuits for manageable layout and design.  
- **Physical Design** — The process of converting a circuit netlist into a physical layout with geometrical and electrical considerations.  
- **Pin Assignment** — The process of assigning physical connection points for blocks or cells.  
- **Placement** — Determining exact locations of blocks or cells on the chip for routing and performance optimization.  
- **Power and Ground Routing** — Special routing for power and ground signals across the chip layout.  
- **Register Transfer Level (RTL)** — A low-level design description expressing data flow and control between registers.  
- **Routing** — The process of interconnecting placed blocks or cells to complete the circuit connections.  
- **Standard Cell** — A semi-custom design style where pre-designed fixed-height cells are placed in rows with channels for routing.  
- **Switchbox Routing** — Detailed routing within a switchbox area used to connect signals between different directions.  
- **Timing Driven Floorplanning** — Floorplanning done with explicit consideration of timing constraints to meet performance goals.  
- **Via** — Contact between metal layers allowing vertical interconnections in multi-layer layouts.

VLSI physical design automation involves the development of algorithms and data structures to efficiently convert circuit diagrams into geometric layouts while meeting fabrication constraints and optimizing performance. This process includes stages such as partitioning, floorplanning, placement, routing, and compaction, with emerging trends emphasizing interconnect delay management, three-dimensional routing, and early design-stage physical considerations.

- **Active layer** — Defines openings in the field oxide (FOX) where MOSFETs are fabricated by exposing the substrate for doping and device formation.  
- **Body (bulk) connection** — The connection of the MOSFET's substrate or well to a fixed potential (ground for NMOS, VDD for PMOS) to prevent parasitic effects.  
- **Contact layer** — Connects metal layers to active (n+/p+) or poly regions to form electrical connections; must avoid direct metal-to-substrate contacts.  
- **Damascene process** — Fabrication technique involving trench formation, material filling, and planarization used for STI and metal layers in CMOS.  
- **ESD Protection Diode** — A diode connected to pads to protect MOSFET gate oxides from electrostatic discharge by clamping voltages outside safe limits.  
- **Field oxide (FOX)** — Thick oxide grown to isolate active areas; areas without active openings where devices are not formed.  
- **Gate oxide (GOX)** — Thin insulating oxide grown over active areas under the polysilicon gate in MOSFETs.  
- **Metal layers (metal1, metal2, etc.)** — Conductive layers used for wiring and interconnections in the CMOS process.  
- **N-select layer** — Mask layer used to implant n-type

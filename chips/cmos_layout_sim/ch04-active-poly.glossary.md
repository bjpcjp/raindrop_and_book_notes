- **Active Layer** — Defines openings in the field oxide (FOX) where MOSFETs are fabricated; exposes silicon for doping.  
- **Body (Bulk) Terminal** — The substrate or well region connected to a fixed voltage; influences MOSFET operation.  
- **Contact** — A small opening etched through the insulator to connect metal layers to underlying active or poly regions.  
- **Damascene Process** — A fabrication method involving trench creation, filling with material, and polishing for planarization, often used for metals.  
- **Diode (ESD Protection Diode)** — A device formed using n-well/p+ or substrate/n+ junctions to protect circuits from electrostatic discharge damage.  
- **ESD (Electrostatic Discharge)** — Sudden flow of electricity through a device caused by static electricity, potentially damaging thin gate oxides.  
- **Field Oxide (FOX)** — Thick oxide grown to isolate active areas on the silicon substrate.  
- **Gate Oxide (GOX)** — Thin oxide layer grown on the silicon surface under the polysilicon gate that controls the MOSFET channel.  
- **Metall (Metal 1)** — The first metal layer used to route wiring, connect transistors, and interface with contacts and vias.  
- **N+ (N-Plus) Layer** — Highly doped n-type region usually implanted in the active area to form MOSFET source/drain or contacts.  
- **N-Select Layer** — Mask used to define where n-type doping implants occur within active areas.  
- **NMOS (N-Channel MOSFET)** — A MOS transistor with n-type source/drain in a p-type substrate or well.  
- **N-Well** — A p-type silicon region implanted into the substrate to contain PMOS devices and isolate them from the substrate.  
- **P+ (P-Plus) Layer** — Highly doped p-type regions implanted in active areas, often for substrates or source/drain of PMOS.  
- **P-Select Layer** — Mask defining where p-type doping implants are applied in active openings.  
- **Pad Oxide** — A thin oxide layer grown under nitride used as a cushion during processing steps.  
- **Poly (Polysilicon) Layer** — Conductive gate material made of small crystalline silicon regions, forms MOSFET gate electrodes.  
- **Polycide** — A composite layer of polysilicon and silicide used to reduce gate sheet resistance.  
- **Self-Aligned Gate** — MOSFET fabrication technique where the poly gate aligns with source/drain implants to avoid misalignment issues.  
- **Select Masks** — Masks that define doping regions (n-select or p-select) which are larger than active openings to compensate for misalignment.  
- **Silicide** — A low-resistance material (silicon combined with a metal like tungsten) deposited on gates and source/drain to reduce resistance.  
- **Silicide Block** — A mask layer preventing silicide formation on certain regions, useful for defining resistors or avoiding short circuits.  
- **Source and Drain** — The two terminals of a MOSFET where current enters and leaves; interchangeable in CMOS layouts.  
- **Standard Cell Frame** — A layout methodology providing power, ground, well, and substrate lines to simplify transistor connection and routing.  
- **STI (Shallow Trench Isolation)** — A method to isolate active devices by etching and filling silicon trenches with oxide.  
- **VDD** — The positive supply voltage node in a CMOS circuit, connected to PMOS bodies (n-wells).  
- **Via** — A conductive link connecting two metal layers vertically through insulating layers.  
- **Well Connection** — Implant and metallization used to tie the n-well or p-well to a reference voltage (VDD or ground).

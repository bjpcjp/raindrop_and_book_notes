- **Bias Circuit** — A circuit that provides stable reference voltages and currents to other parts of an op-amp for proper operation.  
- **Common-Mode Feedback (CMFB)** — A feedback mechanism that stabilizes and sets the output common-mode voltage of fully-differential amplifiers.  
- **Common-Mode Voltage (VCM)** — The average voltage level around which differential signals in an op-amp swing.  
- **Common-Mode Rejection Ratio (CMRR)** — A measure of an amplifier's ability to reject common-mode signals relative to differential signals.  
- **Compensation Capacitor (Cc)** — A capacitor added in an amplifier circuit to ensure stability by controlling frequency response.  
- **Differential Amplifier (Diff-Amp)** — An amplifier that amplifies the voltage difference between two input signals.  
- **Drain Current (ID)** — The current flowing from the drain terminal of a MOSFET transistor.  
- **Drive Strength** — The ability of a transistor to source or sink current, affecting the speed of charging capacitive loads.  
- **Gain-Enhancement (GE)** — Techniques used to increase an amplifier's open-loop gain by adding auxiliary amplifiers.  
- **Gate-Drain Connected MOSFET** — A MOSFET with its gate connected to its drain, typically used as a diode-connected transistor for biasing.  
- **Load Capacitance (CL)** — The capacitive load an amplifier must drive, affecting speed and power.  
- **Miller Effect** — An increase in the effective input capacitance of an amplifier due to feedback through an internal gain stage.  
- **Minimum Channel Length (L)** — The smallest gate length used in MOSFETs to maximize speed but potentially introduce mismatches.  
- **Offset Voltage (Vos)** — A small undesirable voltage that causes an op-amp output to deviate from zero when inputs are equal.  
- **Overdrive Voltage (Vov)** — The voltage above the MOSFET threshold voltage that controls the transistor's operating region and speed.  
- **Output Buffer** — The final stage in an op-amp that provides driving capability to the load, often designed for class AB operation.  
- **Output Common-Mode Voltage** — The average voltage level at the two outputs of a fully-differential op-amp.  
- **Output Swing** — The allowable voltage range an op-amp output can achieve without distortion or clipping.  
- **Quiescent Current** — The steady-state current consumed by a circuit when no input signal is applied.  
- **Switched-Capacitor CMFB** — A common-mode feedback circuit implemented using capacitors and timed switches for high-speed operation.  
- **Tail Current Source** — The current source transistor in the differential input stage that sets the bias current for the diff-amp.  
- **Transition Frequency (fT)** — The frequency at which a transistor's current gain drops to unity, indicating speed capability.  
- **Triode Region Operation** — When a MOSFET operates like a resistor with low gain, affecting amplifier linearity and control.  
- **Unity-Gain Frequency** — The frequency where an amplifier's gain drops to unity, related to the bandwidth of the op-amp.

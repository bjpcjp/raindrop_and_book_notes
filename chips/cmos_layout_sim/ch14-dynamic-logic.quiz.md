1. **Q:** What is the fundamental principle behind dynamic logic gates, and how does leakage current impact the stored charge on a dynamic node?  
   **A:** Dynamic logic gates use the capacitive input of a MOSFET to store charge, thereby remembering a logic level for later use. The stored charge on the dynamic (storage) node can leak away due to MOSFET off currents, which include leakage through source/drain to substrate diodes, edge leakage of poly, and source-to-drain leakage currents. This leakage causes the voltage on the storage node to decay over time, limiting the maximum allowable time for which the node can hold valid data without refresh.  
   **External example:** Dynamic logic's susceptibility to leakage current is discussed in the context of charge storage in MOSFET input capacitances in "CMOS VLSI Design" by Weste and Harris, which explains leakage limitations in deep-submicron devices. https://web.stanford.edu/class/ee273/CMOSDesign.pdf

2. **Q:** How does holding one side of the MOSFET pass gate at VDD/2 instead of ground affect leakage current and discharge rate of the storage node in dynamic logic circuits?  
   **A:** Holding the MOSFET pass gate's input at VDD/2 reduces the voltage across the MOSFET when it is off, thereby minimizing the drain-to-source voltage (VDS) and reducing leakage currents. This slows the discharge rate of the storage node capacitor, increasing storage time. However, if the capacitor voltage equals the gate voltage (VDD/2), leakage currents can act to charge the storage node upwards rather than discharge it, causing the voltage to drift.  
   **External example:** The technique of equilibrating bitlines to VDD/2 in DRAM to minimize leakage and improve retention time is well known, as described in "DRAM Circuit Design: Fundamentals and High-Speed Applications" by Wilfred H. Kao. https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4615-2960-6

3. **Q:** What considerations must be taken into account when simulating dynamic circuits in SPICE, especially regarding leakage currents and convergence?  
   **A:** SPICE inserts a minimum conductance element GMIN to every junction and between MOSFET drain-source to improve convergence, representing a small leakage path (e.g., 1 TΩ resistor corresponds to ~1 pA at 1 V). Although default GMIN and RSHUNT values provide leakage currents that may be significant over milliseconds, they are typically negligible compared to real transistor leakage in nanometer MOSFETs. Adjusting GMIN can improve accuracy but may reduce convergence reliability and slow simulations.  
   **External example:** The role of GMIN and its impact on leakage and convergence is detailed in the "SPICE Circuit Simulation" tutorial by UC Berkeley. https://bwrcs.eecs.berkeley.edu/Classes/IcBook/SPICE/

4. **Q:** Why are nonoverlapping clock signals essential in dynamic shift registers, and how is a nonoverlapping two-phase clock generated?  
   **A:** Nonoverlapping clocks prevent both pass gates in a dynamic shift register stage from being on simultaneously, which would connect input and output nodes directly and cause data corruption. The nonoverlapping condition requires that the logical AND of the two clock signals is zero. A two-phase nonoverlapping clock is generated by delaying one of the clock signals through gates (like NAND and inverters) to create dead time between clock transitions, ensuring one clock goes low before the other goes high.  
   **External example:** Nonoverlapping clocks are used in dynamic shift registers and DRAM arrays for timing control, as explained in Texas Instruments’ application note on DRAM timing requirements. https://www.ti.com/lit/an/slyt126/slyt126.pdf

5. **Q:** How does domino logic improve upon precharge-evaluate (PE) logic in cascading dynamic CMOS gates, and what role does the "keeper" PMOS device play?  
   **A:** Domino logic adds an inverter after the PE stage, eliminating the race condition found in cascaded PE gates where the evaluation delay causes output glitches. By holding the output low after evaluation, later stages are prevented from prematurely activating. The "keeper" PMOS device keeps the dynamic node charged to VDD during precharge and after evaluation when logic is high, compensating for leakage currents and preventing voltage droop, while being weak enough to allow the NMOS logic to pull the node low when required.  
   **External example:** The function and design of keeper devices in domino logic are explained in "Digital Integrated Circuits" by Jan M. Rabaey et al. https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~demmel/cs267_sp08/handouts/Rabaey_Digital_Integrated_Circuits.pdf

6. **Q:** Describe the operational difference between clocked CMOS latch and dynamic logic in terms of storage node stability and output drive during clock phases.  
   **A:** In a clocked CMOS latch, during the low clock phase, the master stage passes the input through and the slave stage output is held (with the output node being a storage node). When the clock goes high, the master turns off and the slave actively drives the output. The storage node can drift due to leakage and capacitive coupling, potentially moving the input voltage of the slave inverter towards its switching threshold and causing significant short-circuit current. Dynamic logic also relies on charge storage but usually only drives valid logic outputs in one clock phase, without active drive in the storage phase, making it more sensitive to leakage-induced drift.  
   **External example:** The issues of storage node stability and current in latch stages are discussed in "CMOS Digital Integrated Circuits" by Kang and Leblebici. https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/cmos-digital-integrated-circuits-second-edition

7. **Q:** How does pipelining in NP logic adders affect throughput and latency when extending from 1-bit to multi-bit additions?  
   **A:** Pipelining uses clocked latches to delay input and output bits, allowing continuous input of new operands each clock cycle and achieving higher throughput. For a 1-bit NP logic adder, each addition completes in one clock cycle. For a 4-bit pipelined adder, the final sum is obtained after four clock cycles, but new inputs can be accepted each subsequent cycle. Increasing word size to 32 bits similarly increases the latency proportionally (32 cycles), but the throughput stays the same if new operands arrive every cycle. Thus, pipelining improves throughput but adds latency proportional to word length.  
   **External example:** Pipelining concepts for adders are explained in "Computer Organization and Design" by David A. Patterson and John L. Hennessy. https://booksite.elsevier.com/9780124077263/

8. **Q:** What are the trade-offs in using transmission gates (CMOS TG) as pass switches in dynamic logic regarding charge leakage?  
   **A:** CMOS transmission gates have both PMOS and NMOS transistors conducting, so their leakage stems from both drain-well diode of the PMOS and drain-substrate diode of the NMOS. Since these leakages may be unequal, the dynamic node can leak either towards VDD or ground, unlike a single NMOS pass gate where leakage tends to only discharge the node. This asymmetry can cause the stored charge to drift unpredictably, requiring design attention to device sizing and leakage balancing.  
   **External example:** The leakage characteristics of transmission gates in dynamic logic are described in "Digital Integrated Circuit Design" by Ken Kundert. https://bwrcs.eecs.berkeley.edu/Classes/IcBook/SPICE/leak.htm

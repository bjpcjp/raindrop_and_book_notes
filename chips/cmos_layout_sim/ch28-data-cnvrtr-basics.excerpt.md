Data converters translate analog signals into digital representations and vice versa, with key concepts including sampling, quantization, and the associated errors such as differential and integral nonlinearity, offset, gain, and aperture errors. Proper design and layout of mixed-signal circuits, including strategies like shielding, guard rings, and careful power routing, are critical to minimize noise and ensure accurate conversions according to specifications like resolution, signal-to-noise ratio, and the Nyquist sampling criterion.

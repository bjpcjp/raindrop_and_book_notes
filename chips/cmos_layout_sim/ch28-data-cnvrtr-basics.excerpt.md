Data converters translate analog signals to digital form and vice versa, with their performance dependent on factors such as sampling rate, resolution, and errors including differential and integral nonlinearity. Key concepts such as the Nyquist Criterion, quantization error, and mixed-signal layout considerations are essential to optimizing accuracy and minimizing noise in practical data conversion systems.

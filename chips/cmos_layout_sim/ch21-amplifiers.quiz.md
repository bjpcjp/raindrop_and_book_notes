1. **Q:** Explain the trade-offs between using a gate-drain-connected MOSFET load versus a current source load in a common-source amplifier, including their effects on gain, bandwidth, and output impedance.
   **A:** A gate-drain-connected MOSFET load provides large bandwidth and low output impedance but at the cost of reduced gain (typically close to unity). In contrast, a current source load offers higher gain and higher output impedance but with lower bandwidth. Therefore, gate-drain loads are suited for wideband applications with modest gain, while current source loads are preferred when maximum gain and output impedance are needed, though bandwidth is reduced. Current source load amplifiers are also preferred for use with external feedback.
   **External example:** This trade-off is well discussed in Sedra and Smith’s “Microelectronic Circuits” which explains that active loads (current sources) increase gain but reduce bandwidth compared to diode-connected loads. https://web.stanford.edu/class/ee208/text/ee208b10.pdf

2. **Q:** Describe how Miller's theorem explains the effect of feedback capacitance on the input capacitance and frequency response of common-source amplifiers, and identify the consequences of the Right-Half Plane zero neglected by Miller's theorem.
   **A:** Miller's theorem shows that the effective input capacitance due to a feedback capacitor between output and input is multiplied by the gain magnitude (|Av| + 1), increasing the input capacitance and lowering bandwidth. This is because the large voltage swing across the capacitor amplifies displacement current. However, Miller’s theorem neglects the right-half plane (RHP) zero caused by the direct capacitive feedthrough between input and output at high frequencies. The RHP zero causes phase shifts that can destabilize the amplifier under feedback by acting as positive feedback and increasing settling time.

3. **Q:** What is pole splitting in CMOS amplifiers with current source loads, what causes it, and how does it affect the locations of the input and output poles?
   **A:** Pole splitting occurs in CMOS amplifiers with large gain and significant Miller capacitance, where the output pole shifts to a much higher frequency than predicted by naive Miller analysis. It is caused because above the input pole frequency, the gain decreases, reducing the effective Miller input capacitance and causing the input voltage to flatten out instead of continuing to drop. This decouples the poles, lowering the input pole frequency while pushing the output pole frequency upward, thereby “splitting” the poles apart and increasing bandwidth.
   **External example:** Razavi’s “RF Microelectronics” discusses pole splitting as a fundamental bandwidth extension mechanism in MOSFET amplifiers. https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6128053

4. **Q:** How does a source follower amplifier affect input capacitance and noise compared to a common-source amplifier, and why is it often used as an input buffer despite its lower gain?
   **A:** A source follower's input capacitance is approximately equal to the gate-drain capacitance because the gate and source terminals move together, eliminating the Miller effect that inflates input capacitance in common-source amplifiers. This gives the source follower a low input capacitance, beneficial for driving high-impedance sources. However, its gain is near unity, so it offers no gain and generally worse input-referred noise compared to common-source or common-gate amplifiers. It is used as an input buffer mainly to preserve signal integrity and reduce loading effects, not to amplify.

5. **Q:** Compare the DC operating constraints and efficiency (PCE) of Class A output buffers using source followers with Class AB push-pull output stages in CMOS amplifier designs.
   **A:** Class A output buffers with source followers have continuous bias current, causing power dissipation even without output signal activity, typically resulting in PCE limited to ~12.5% under ideal swing conditions. Class AB push-pull output stages dynamically bias either NMOS or PMOS transistor depending on the signal polarity, reducing static power consumption and allowing output voltage to swing rail-to-rail. This class AB operation achieves much higher power conversion efficiency (up to ~75% or more), making them preferable for output buffers especially when driving low-resistance loads.

6. **Q:** Explain how the floating current source formed by MFCP and MFCN in a push-pull amplifier bias network impacts the output resistance and gain of the current source load.
   **A:** The floating current source formed by MFCP and MFCN does not reduce the output resistance of the current source load (M3 and M4 cascoded devices) because the negative feedback inherent in the floating current source cancels the loading effect. This ensures that the output resistance remains high, preserving the high gain of the cascode current source load stage. Thus, the floating current source bias does not degrade the gain or output impedance of the amplifier.
   **External example:** Kang and Leblebici’s “CMOS Digital Integrated Circuits” discuss how feedback bias current mirrors maintain output impedance in cascoded loads. https://books.google.com/books?id=Tc7jBgAAQBAJ

7. **Q:** What role does the zero-nulling resistor play in the frequency response of single-stage CMOS amplifiers with Miller capacitance, and how does it influence stability?
   **A:** The zero-nulling resistor is added in series with the Miller feedback capacitor to attenuate the high-frequency feedthrough current that causes a non-minimum phase right-half plane zero in the amplifier’s frequency response. By choosing the resistor value approximately equal to the reciprocal of the transconductance (\(1/g_m\)), it pushes the problematic RHP zero to infinite frequency or even into the left-half plane, thereby improving phase margin and ensuring amplifier stability under feedback.
   **External example:** Franco’s “Design with Operational Amplifiers and Analog Integrated Circuits” explains how zero cancellation via series resistor improves feedback amplifier stability. https://books.google.com/books?id=YPp6DwAAQBAJ

8. **Q:** Describe how distortion arises in CMOS output buffers with large output swings and limited bias currents, and how feedback can mitigate this distortion.
   **A:** Distortion arises when the AC component of the drain current approaches or exceeds the DC bias current, causing the transistor’s gain and operating point to vary with the input signal amplitude—violating the small-signal assumption of constant gain. Large output swings in buffers with limited bias currents therefore produce nonlinearities, increasing harmonic distortion. Feedback reduces this distortion by stabilizing the gain and linearizing the transfer function, making the overall closed-loop gain less sensitive to input amplitude variations.
   **External example:** Razavi discusses large-signal distortion and feedback linearization in CMOS output stages for RF circuits. https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4034698

9. **Q:** How does the transconductance and output resistance relationship determine the voltage gain and input impedance of common-gate and transimpedance amplifiers with cascode loads?
   **A:** In common-gate and transimpedance amplifiers with cascode loads, the output resistance is greatly increased due to cascoding (approximately the product of transconductances and output resistances of stacked transistors). The voltage gain is the product of the input transistor’s transconductance and the high output resistance, resulting in large gain. The input impedance of the common-gate stage is roughly the reciprocal of the input transistor’s transconductance (\(1/g_m\)), providing a low input impedance suitable for current inputs. The transimpedance gain is the product of this output resistance and input transconductance, converting input current to output voltage.

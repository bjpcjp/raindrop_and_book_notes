- **Accumulation** — Condition where mobile charge carriers (holes for NMOS) gather under the gate oxide when VGS is negative.
- **Body Effect** — Increase in MOSFET threshold voltage caused by a voltage difference between the source and substrate (VSB).
- **Capacitance (Cox)** — Gate oxide capacitance per unit area, representing the capacitive coupling between gate and channel.
- **Channel Length Modulation (CLM)** — Variation of the effective channel length with drain voltage, causing an increase in drain current in saturation.
- **Depletion Region** — Area beneath the gate oxide depleted of free carriers, forming when gate voltage is between accumulation and inversion.
- **Drain-Induced Barrier Lowering (DIBL)** — Effect where increasing drain voltage reduces the threshold voltage, enhancing drain current.
- **Drain Current (ID)** — Current flowing from drain to source in a MOSFET, controlled by gate voltage.
- **Flatband Voltage (VFB)** — Gate voltage at which surface potential equals bulk potential, resulting in zero net charge in the channel.
- **Gate-to-Drain Overlap Capacitance (Cgd)** — Parasitic capacitance due to gate overlapping the drain region, present regardless of bias.
- **Gate-to-Source Overlap Capacitance (Cgs)** — Parasitic capacitance due to gate overlapping the source region.
- **Mobility (μ)** — Measure of how quickly carriers (electrons or holes) move through the channel under an electric field.
- **NMOS** — NMOS transistor using electrons as majority carriers, with substrate usually connected to ground.
- **P-MOS** — PMOS transistor using holes as majority carriers, with the well often tied to VDD.
- **Punchthrough** — Condition where the depletion regions from source and drain merge, causing device failure.
- **Short-Channel Effects** — Performance degradations arising in MOSFETs with very small channel lengths.
- **Substrate (Bulk)** — The semiconductor material in which the MOSFET channel is formed.
- **Subthreshold Current** — Small drain current flowing when gate voltage is below threshold, due to carrier diffusion.
- **Surface States (Qss)** — Interface traps at the oxide-semiconductor boundary that can alter threshold voltage.
- **Threshold Voltage (VTHN, VTHP)** — The gate voltage at which a sufficient inversion layer forms, enabling conduction.
- **Triode Region** — MOSFET operation region where the channel is continuous and behaves like a voltage-controlled resistor.
- **Velocity Saturation** — Limiting drift velocity of carriers at high electric fields in short-channel devices.
- **Weak Inversion (Subthreshold)** — Operation region where the channel forms via carrier diffusion rather than drift; current increases exponentially with gate voltage.
- **Wide Channel (W)** — The width dimension of a MOSFET channel, affecting drive current.
- **LDD (Lightly Doped Drain)** — Drain structure with a lightly doped region to reduce electric field and hot carrier effects.

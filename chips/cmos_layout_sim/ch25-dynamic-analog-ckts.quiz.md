1. **Q:** What are the primary nonideal effects associated with MOSFET switches in dynamic analog circuits, and how do these effects impact sampled-data systems like data converters?
   **A:** The two primary nonideal effects are charge injection and clock feedthrough. Charge injection occurs when charge stored in the MOSFET channel is injected onto the load capacitor upon switch turn-off, causing a voltage change that is often nonlinear with respect to the input voltage, resulting in harmonic distortion and nonlinearity errors. Clock feedthrough happens due to capacitive coupling between the switch gate and source/drain, causing the clock signal to appear as a disturbance on the load capacitor. In sampled-data systems such as data converters, these effects limit the accuracy by introducing offsets and distortions. Minimizing these effects is crucial for high-precision dynamic circuits.

2. **Q:** Explain how fully-differential op-amp topologies reduce the impact of charge injection and clock feedthrough in dynamic sample-and-hold circuits.
   **A:** Fully-differential op-amps have outputs that produce differential signals, with common-mode feedback (CMFB) circuits maintaining the common-mode voltage. Charge injection and clock feedthrough typically appear as common-mode disturbances on both differential outputs. Since the amplifier ideally rejects common-mode signals due to its Common-Mode Rejection Ratio (CMRR), these unwanted effects are significantly suppressed. Moreover, differential topologies improve dynamic range because offset voltages caused by charge injection become common-mode and do not affect the differential output as strongly.
   **External example:** The advantage of differential architectures in noise and distortion reduction is widely applied in precision ADCs, as explained by Analog Devices: https://www.analog.com/en/analog-dialogue/articles/differential-signals-and-differential-amplifiers.html

3. **Q:** Derive the resistance value of a switched-capacitor resistor and explain why this resistor can be made precise and stable on-chip compared to a large integrated resistor.
   **A:** The switched-capacitor resistor is formed by alternately connecting a capacitor, C, between two nodes at a switching frequency f_clk. During each cycle, charge C(V1 - V2) is transferred, producing an average current I_avg = C f_clk (V1 - V2). Thus, the equivalent resistance is R_sc = 1 / (C f_clk). Unlike large resistors, this value depends only on an accurate ratio of capacitor sizes and a clock frequency, both of which can be tightly controlled on-chip, making it more precise and stable than a large fabricated resistor that suffers from process variations and layout-dependent parasitics.
   **External example:** The principle of switched-capacitor resistors and their precision is explained in Texas Instruments’ Switched-Capacitor Filter Technical Handbook: https://www.ti.com/lit/an/slaa043/slaa043.pdf

4. **Q:** Why is connecting the input signal to the bottom plate of sampling capacitors (poly1) in a fully-differential sample-and-hold circuit beneficial, and what are the effects of parasitic capacitances in this configuration?
   **A:** Connecting the input signal to the bottom plate reduces the effect of substrate noise since parasitic capacitances to the substrate on the bottom plate are driven either by the input source or the op-amp output, both low-impedance nodes that suppress noise impact. This approach avoids charging parasitic capacitances with the held voltage, which would slow settling and create gain errors. Moreover, it minimizes the attenuation due to parasitic capacitances on the top plate, improving settling time and linearity.
   **External example:** Bottom-plate sampling techniques and parasitic capacitance impact are discussed in IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4300770

5. **Q:** Describe the method and the role of dummy switches in reducing charge injection and clock feedthrough in MOS switches.
   **A:** Dummy switches are placed in series with the main switch but with drain and source shorted, controlled by the complementary clock signal, and slightly delayed relative to the main switch. When the main switch turns off, charge injected toward the dummy switch is matched by the charge induced by the dummy switch, thereby canceling out the net charge injection onto the load capacitor. Similarly, the dummy switch’s own charge injection does not affect the load since it is injected into a low impedance node. This technique effectively reduces the charge injection and related nonlinearities.
   **External example:** Dummy switch compensation techniques are detailed in Eichenberger and Guggenbuhl’s IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4482338

6. **Q:** How does the kT/C noise limit impact capacitor choice in sample-and-hold circuits, and what trade-offs must a designer consider?
   **A:** The kT/C noise is the thermal noise introduced during sampling and is inversely proportional to the capacitor size. Larger capacitors reduce noise voltage but require more time to charge, limiting speed. Smaller capacitors enable faster sampling but increase noise, degrading signal integrity. Designers must balance speed requirements against settling noise, selecting a capacitor size that minimizes noise while allowing high-speed operation.
   **External example:** The kT/C noise trade-offs are explained along with design guidelines in Analog Devices’ “Designing with Operational Amplifiers” Handbook: https://www.analog.com/en/education/education-library/design-principles-op-amps.html

7. **Q:** What are the benefits of using switched-capacitor integrators over continuous-time RC integrators, particularly with regards to parasitic capacitance sensitivity?
   **A:** Switched-capacitor integrators simulate large resistors without relying on high-value physical resistors, thus enabling precise and small-area implementations. They are parasitic insensitive because parasitic capacitances connected to nodes held at the common-mode voltage do not affect charge transfer. This reduces gain errors and improves linearity compared to continuous-time RC integrators, where parasitics directly degrade performance.
   **External example:** Parasitic insensitive switched-capacitor integrators are explained in Broderson, Gray, and Hodges' IEEE Proceedings: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/40915

8. **Q:** Why is it necessary to use common-mode feedback (CMFB) circuits when implementing fully-differential op-amps, and what happens if CMFB is not employed?
   **A:** CMFB circuits stabilize and set the common-mode output voltage of fully-differential op-amps because the difference-mode gain ensures inputs are equal, but without CMFB, any common-mode output voltage between ground and VDD could satisfy this equality. Without CMFB, outputs may saturate at rails or drift, causing distortion and loss of linearity. CMFB forces the output common-mode voltage to a defined level, typically VDD/2, ensuring balanced operation.
   **External example:** The necessity of CMFB is detailed in Analog Devices’ Application Note on Fully Differential Amplifiers: https://www.analog.com/media/en/technical-documentation/application-notes/AN-774.pdf

9. **Q:** Explain how dynamic current mirrors reduce threshold voltage mismatches and what the role of the clock signals is in this configuration.
   **A:** Dynamic current mirrors use switches clocked in a non-overlapping two-phase sequence. In phase one, the reference current sets the gate voltage of the mirror transistor, storing the gate charge on a capacitor. In phase two, this stored charge controls the output transistor, replicating the current. The clock signals ensure that the mirror transistor is connected only during the reference setting phase and disconnected during output, thus reducing static mismatches caused by threshold voltage variation. The dynamic operation effectively transfers the gate voltage, rather than relying on static matching.
   **External example:** Dynamic biasing and current mirrors reducing mismatch are discussed in IEEE Solid-State Circuits literature: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/188708/

10. **Q:** How does the exact frequency response of a switched-capacitor integrator deviate from the ideal at higher input frequencies, and what implications does this have for circuit design?
    **A:** The exact output of a switched-capacitor integrator includes terms that introduce frequency-dependent errors due to the discrete-time switching operation, causing magnitude and phase deviations as the input frequency approaches the switching frequency (f_clk). Ideal continuous-time behavior assumes input frequencies much less than f_clk to minimize these errors. Designers must choose f_clk sufficiently higher than the signal bandwidth to ensure accurate integration and avoid aliasing, constraining the maximum input frequency and influencing the choice of f_clk for system performance.
    **External example:** The frequency response and aliasing in switched-capacitor circuits are described in the IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/41159

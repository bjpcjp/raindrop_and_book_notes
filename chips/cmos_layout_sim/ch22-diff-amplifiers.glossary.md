- **AC Gain** — The small-signal voltage gain of a differential amplifier for alternating current signals.  
- **Body Effect** — Variation in a MOSFET’s threshold voltage caused by changes in voltage between the body and source terminals.  
- **CMRR (Common-Mode Rejection Ratio)** — A measure of a differential amplifier’s ability to reject signals common to both inputs, usually expressed in decibels.  
- **Common-Mode Input Voltage** — The average voltage applied simultaneously to both inputs of a differential amplifier.  
- **Current Differential Amplifier** — A differential amplifier design where input and output signals are currents rather than voltages.  
- **Current Mirror Load** — An active load for differential pairs using current mirror circuitry to convert current variations to voltage output.  
- **Differential Amplifier (Diff-Amp)** — A circuit that amplifies the difference between two input signals while rejecting common signals.  
- **Differential Input Voltage** — The voltage difference applied between the gates of the two transistors in a differential pair.  
- **Differential Pair (Diff-Pair)** — A pair of matched transistors arranged to amplify the difference between two input signals.  
- **Differential Mode Gain (Ad)** — The gain of a differential amplifier for differential input signals.  
- **Input-Referred Offset Voltage** — The equivalent input voltage difference required to produce zero output in the presence of device mismatches.  
- **Load Resistance** — The resistance connected to the output node of an amplifier affecting gain and output swing.  
- **Long-Channel Device** — A MOSFET with a channel length long enough so that short-channel effects are negligible.  
- **Minimum Common-Mode Voltage (VCMMIN)** — The lowest input common-mode voltage at which the differential amplifier maintains proper operation.  
- **Maximum Common-Mode Voltage (VCMMAX)** — The highest input common-mode voltage at which the differential amplifier maintains proper operation.  
- **Mismatch** — Differences in device parameters such as threshold voltage and geometry causing offset and gain errors.  
- **NMOS Differential Pair** — A differential pair constructed using n-channel MOSFET transistors.  
- **Output Swing** — The range over which the output voltage of an amplifier can vary without distortion or cutoff.  
- **Rail-to-Rail Input Stage** — A differential amplifier input stage that can accept input voltages ranging from ground to supply voltage.  
- **Slew Rate** — The maximum rate of change of an amplifier’s output voltage, limited by current and load capacitance.  
- **Small-Signal Model** — A linearized circuit representation used to analyze amplifier behavior for small AC signals.  
- **Source-Coupled Pair** — A basic diff-pair where the sources of the two transistors are connected together and biased by a current source.  
- **Source Cross-Coupled Pair** — A differential amplifier topology with cross-connected sources providing class AB operation and higher output current.  
- **Transconductance (gm)** — The change in output current per unit change in input voltage of a transistor.  
- **Triode Region** — The operating region of a MOSFET where it behaves like a voltage-controlled resistor.  
- **Wide-Swing Differential Amplifier** — A diff-amp designed to maintain performance over a large input voltage range, often using complementary pairs.

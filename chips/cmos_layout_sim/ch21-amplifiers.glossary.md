- **Active load** — A MOSFET used instead of a resistor as a load in amplifiers to save chip area and increase gain.  
- **Body effect** — Variation in MOSFET threshold voltage caused by source-bulk voltage differences, affecting gain.  
- **Cascode amplifier** — A high-gain amplifier formed by stacking transistors to increase output resistance and reduce Miller effect.  
- **Class A amplifier** — An amplifier where both devices conduct current continuously, leading to low efficiency.  
- **Class AB amplifier** — An amplifier where one or both devices conduct current depending on the input, improving efficiency.  
- **Common-drain (source follower) amplifier** — An amplifier with output taken from the source, providing voltage gain near unity and low output impedance.  
- **Common-gate amplifier** — An amplifier with the gate terminal common to both input and output, exhibiting low input impedance.  
- **Common-source amplifier** — An amplifier with the source terminal common to both input and output, widely used for voltage gain.  
- **Current source load** — A MOSFET biased as a current source to provide a large output resistance load for high gain.  
- **DC operating point** — The steady-state voltage and current conditions in a circuit before any signal is applied.  
- **Distortion** — Nonlinear behavior of an amplifier resulting in harmonics at multiples of the input frequency.  
- **Dominant pole** — The lowest-frequency pole that primarily determines the bandwidth of an amplifier.  
- **Floating current source** — A current source with neither terminal connected directly to ground or supply, used for biasing.  
- **Gate-drain-connected load** — A MOSFET with gate and drain tied together acting as a resistive load.  
- **Miller capacitance** — An effective input capacitance multiplied by (1 + gain) due to feedback through gate-drain capacitor.  
- **Miller theorem** — A method to simplify circuits with feedback capacitors by splitting a capacitor into two grounded capacitors.  
- **Noise power spectral density (PSD)** — The distribution of noise power across frequencies in a circuit.  
- **Open-circuit gain** — The maximum gain of a MOSFET stage when loaded only by its output resistance.  
- **Output impedance** — The small-signal resistance looking into the output terminal of an amplifier.  
- **Pole splitting** — Phenomenon where two poles of an amplifier move apart in frequency due to feedback effects.  
- **Push-pull amplifier** — An output stage where complementary transistors alternately source and sink current for rail-to-rail output.  
- **Right-half-plane (RHP) zero** — A zero in the amplifier's transfer function that causes non-minimum phase behavior and can reduce stability.  
- **Small-signal transconductance (gm)** — The incremental change in drain current per change in gate-source voltage of a MOSFET.  
- **Source degeneration** — Adding resistance in the source terminal of a MOSFET to reduce gain and improve linearity.  
- **Source impedance (Rs)** — The AC resistance or impedance at the input/source node driving an amplifier.  
- **Slew rate** — The maximum rate at which an amplifier's output voltage can change, limited by current and load capacitance.  
- **Transimpedance amplifier** — An amplifier converting input current to an output voltage, characterized by transresistance gain.  
- **Total harmonic distortion (THD)** — The ratio of the sum of powers of all harmonic frequencies above the fundamental to the fundamental power.  
- **Unity-gain frequency (fT)** — The frequency where the amplifier's gain magnitude equals one; important for bandwidth estimation.

This chapter discusses dynamic analog circuits that utilize MOSFET switches to sample, hold, and process analog signals with reduced power dissipation and component count, addressing key nonidealities such as charge injection and clock feedthrough. It explores fully-differential topologies, switched-capacitor circuits, and dynamic techniques for offset cancellation, current mirrors, amplifiers, and comparators to improve signal fidelity and circuit performance in integrated CMOS designs.

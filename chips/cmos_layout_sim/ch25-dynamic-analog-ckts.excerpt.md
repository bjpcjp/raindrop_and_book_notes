Dynamic analog circuits exploit the ability to store information on capacitors or MOSFET gate capacitances for a period of time, enabling applications such as sample-and-hold circuits, current mirrors, amplifiers, and filters that utilize MOSFET switches and switched-capacitor techniques to achieve precise, low-power analog signal processing while mitigating nonideal effects like charge injection, clock feedthrough, and thermal noise through methods such as dummy switches, fully-differential topologies, and careful circuit and layout design. These dynamic techniques enable high-accuracy operations by converting continuous-time analog functions into discrete-time implementations characterized by switched-capacitor resistors and integrators, with considerations for noise, offset cancellation, and amplifier settling times essential to optimal performance.

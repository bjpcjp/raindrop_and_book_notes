1. **Q:** Explain the operation and biasing requirements of a source-coupled differential amplifier pair (diff-pair), and how do the maximum and minimum differential and common-mode input voltages relate to device parameters?  
   **A:** The source-coupled diff-pair is biased by a constant current source Iss split between two matched MOSFETs, Ml and M2. When gate voltages are equal and both transistors operate in saturation, the current splits equally (Id1 = Id2 = Iss/2). The differential input voltage (vDI = Vgs1 - Vgs2) controls the currents iD1 and iD2 according to the transistor operation (Eq. 22.6). The maximum differential input voltage VDIMAX occurs when one transistor conducts all the current (Id = Iss), and the other is off, given by VDIMAX < [2Iss / (Kp (W/L))]^0.5 (Eq. 22.7). The minimum is the negative of this. For common-mode inputs, VCMMAX is limited by the drain-source voltage needed for saturation and device threshold voltages; for an NMOS diff-amp VCMMAX ~ VDD + VTHN (Eq. 22.10), and VCMMIN depends on the minimum VDS across the current source and devices (Eq. 22.11). Thus, biasing ensures both stability and proper operation without devices entering triode or cutoff regions.

2. **Q:** How does incorporating a current mirror load affect the AC gain and common-mode input voltage range of a source-coupled differential amplifier?  
   **A:** Adding a current mirror load converts the diff-amp output from current-mode to voltage-mode (Fig. 22.6). The differential mode gain becomes Ad = gm(ro2 || ro4), where ro2 and ro4 are output resistances of Ml and the current mirror transistor M4 (Eq. 22.22). The maximum common-mode input voltage extends due to the PMOS load’s gate-source voltage requirements and is given by VCMMAX = VDD - VSG + VTHN (Eq. 22.12), higher than the basic diff-amp case. The minimum remains as per Eq. 22.11. The output voltage swing is limited on the high end by M4 saturation (VOUTMAX = VDD - VSD,sat) and on the low end by M2 saturation (VOUTMIN = Vn - VTHN) (Eqs. 22.13 and 22.14). This configuration improves voltage gain and output swing but constrains input common-mode range.

3. **Q:** Describe how the source cross-coupled differential pair operates differently from the source-coupled pair, including its advantages, input signal range, and specific design considerations.  
   **A:** The source cross-coupled pair (Fig. 22.22) adds transistors cross-wired at the sources, allowing class AB operation. As the differential input voltage vDI changes, one side’s current increases while the other decreases, but neither current becomes zero as long as magnitudes stay below Iss. This leads to increased output current drive capability without increasing quiescent current, improving slew rate and power efficiency (Fig. 22.24). However, the input common-mode range is limited, with the NMOS version favoring positive input swings and the PMOS version favoring negative (Fig. 22.25 and 22.26). Biasing must consider body effects and layout to balance currents, and additional capacitors may be needed to avoid slew-rate limitations in bias circuits.

4. **Q:** What is the importance of the Common-Mode Rejection Ratio (CMRR) in differential amplifiers, how is it affected by device parameters and input frequency, and how can it be improved?  
   **A:** The CMRR measures a diff-amp’s ability to reject signals common to both inputs while amplifying differential signals. It is given by CMRR = 20 log(Ad / Ac) with Ad the differential gain and Ac the common-mode gain (Eq. 22.27). Ac depends inversely on the output resistance Ro of the biasing current source; higher Ro reduces common-mode gain and improves CMRR. At higher frequencies, parasitic capacitances lower Ro’s impedance, reducing CMRR (Fig. 22.16). Device matching, large Ro, and minimizing source node capacitance enhance CMRR. Imperfect matching causes input-referred offset voltages that degrade performance (Eqs. 22.28–22.30).

5. **Q:** How do device mismatches impact the input-referred offset voltage of differential pairs, and what design and layout techniques reduce this offset?  
   **A:** Device mismatches (threshold voltage differences, geometry variations, load resistance differences) cause imbalance in currents and voltages in the diff-pair, appearing as an input-referred offset voltage Vos = ΔVTHN + (ΔRL/RL)(VGS - VTHN) + (Δ(W/L)/(W/L))(VGS - VTHN) (Eq. 22.29). To minimize offset, layout techniques like common-centroid configurations are used (Fig. 22.18) to cancel gradient effects and ensure matched parasitic capacitances, especially at gates and drains. Using large devices reduces device variation and mismatch, decreasing threshold voltage variation impact, and designing with small overdrive voltages (VGS close to VTHN) reduces the effect of geometry and resistance mismatch.

6. **Q:** Discuss the factors that limit the minimum power supply voltage (VDDmin) for differential amplifiers and how circuit design choices affect this parameter.  
   **A:** The minimum supply voltage is determined by the sum of minimum voltage drops required to keep all devices in saturation and maintain sufficient voltage across the current source (Eq. 22.15). Typically, this includes minimum voltage across the input transistor, the output transistor (current source), and cascode devices if used. The "weak link" is often the gate-source voltage (VSG) of the current source transistors. Using simple single-transistor biasing reduces required voltage drops and can lower VDDmin (example gives VDDmin ≈ 500 mV for short-channel devices in Table 9.2). Circuit configuration (cascode vs. simple current source) and device sizing directly affect VDDmin.

7. **Q:** How does the small-signal AC gain of a differential amplifier with a current mirror load arise from its transistor parameters and topology?  
   **A:** Replacing the diode-connected load with a current mirror increases output resistance by mirroring currents. The small-signal output voltage is Vout = 2 id (ro2 || ro4) with id the differential current (Eq. 22.21). The differential gain is Ad = gm (ro2 || ro4) (Eq. 22.22), where gm is the transconductance of the input transistor and ro are output resistances. The current mirror ensures amplification by creating an active load with high impedance, increasing output voltage change for a differential input voltage. The gain depends on the product of gm and the parallel combination of output resistances of the input device and the current mirror load transistor.

8. **Q:** Why are rail-to-rail differential amplifiers often constructed with complementary (both NMOS and PMOS) diff-pairs, and how is constant transconductance maintained across the input voltage range?  
   **A:** Complementary diff-pairs (n-channel and p-channel) extend input common-mode range from near ground up to near VDD, ensuring continuous operation (Fig. 22.32, 22.34). To avoid gain and distortion problems, their transconductances sum to a constant value across the entire range by ensuring that when one diff-pair current reduces, the other increases, satisfying gm = gmn + gmp = constant (Eq. 22.55). Additional bias currents (I0) are added when a diff-pair is off to keep gm constant (Eq. 22.59). This maintains stable gain and compensation throughout the input range.

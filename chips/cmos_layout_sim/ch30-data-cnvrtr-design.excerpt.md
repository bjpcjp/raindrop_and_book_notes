This chapter discusses the implementation methods and trade-offs for designing data converters in nanometer CMOS technology, focusing on resistor-based R-2R and current-steering DAC topologies, op-amp requirements, and the design of pipeline ADCs. It highlights challenges due to reduced supply voltages, matching and linearity concerns, and techniques such as segmentation and calibration to improve DAC accuracy, while also addressing critical op-amp parameters like gain, bandwidth, and offset for effective data converter performance.

This chapter discusses the implementation challenges and design techniques for data converters, focusing on R-2R resistor networks and current-source DACs in nanometer CMOS technology, as well as the critical role of op-amps in ensuring accuracy and dynamic range. It covers practical issues such as resistor matching, output swing limitations, offset and gain calibration, and architectures for ADCs including cyclic and pipeline converters, highlighting methods to improve linearity, reduce offset errors, and meet speed and resolution requirements.

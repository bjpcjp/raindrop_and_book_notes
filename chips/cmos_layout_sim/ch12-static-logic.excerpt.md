This chapter discusses CMOS static logic gates, focusing on the DC characteristics, dynamic behavior, and layout of NAND, NOR, and complex gates such as AOI, XOR, and full adders, including their switching delays and design considerations. It also covers specialized logic techniques like cascode voltage switch logic, differential split-level logic, and tri-state buffers, providing equations, examples, and layouts to guide practical CMOS circuit design and simulation.

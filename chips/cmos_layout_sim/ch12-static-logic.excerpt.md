This chapter covers the DC characteristics, dynamic behavior, and layout of CMOS static logic gates, focusing primarily on NAND and NOR gates, their switching points, propagation delays, and design considerations including complex logic implementations like AOI, XOR, full adders, as well as alternative logic styles such as CVSL and DSL. Examples and practical notes illustrate gate design, delay estimation, and switching behavior, emphasizing why NAND gates are preferred in CMOS design due to better noise margins and transient characteristics.

This chapter focuses on the design, layout, and simulation of current mirrors, emphasizing achieving high output resistance to maintain constant output current despite voltage variations. It covers basic and cascode current mirror structures, biasing techniques including Beta-multiplier references, temperature behavior, matching and layout considerations, and advanced methods such as regulated drain current mirrors for both long- and short-channel CMOS processes.

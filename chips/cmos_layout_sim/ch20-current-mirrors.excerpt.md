This chapter focuses on the design, simulation, and layout of current mirrors, emphasizing achieving high output resistance to maintain constant output current despite voltage variations. It details various current mirror configurations, biasing techniques, and layout considerations to improve device matching, power supply independence, and temperature stability in both long- and short-channel CMOS processes.

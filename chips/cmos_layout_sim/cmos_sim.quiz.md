1. **Q:** Describe the CMOS IC design process, including its key steps and why understanding layout and parasitics is important for precision/high-speed design.  
   **A:** The CMOS IC design process involves defining circuit inputs and outputs (specifications), hand calculations, circuit simulations, circuit layout, simulations including parasitics, reevaluation of inputs and outputs, fabrication, and testing. Understanding layout and parasitics (stray capacitances, inductances, and junction effects) is crucial because these can cause issues like breakdown, stored charge problems, and latch-up, all of which impact the precision and speed of integrated circuits.  
   **External example:** The IEEE textbook "CMOS VLSI Design" similarly emphasizes understanding layout parasitics to optimize high-speed digital circuits. (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/778491)

2. **Q:** Explain the significance of wafer fabrication in CMOS IC manufacturing and the role of MOSIS in facilitating chip fabrication.  
   **A:** CMOS ICs are fabricated on silicon wafers, each containing multiple identical dice (chips). MOSIS enables low-cost fabrication by combining multiple chip designs on a single multiproject wafer, allowing cost-sharing among different projects. It coordinates fabrication with commercial manufacturers and manages wafer dicing and packaging. MOSIS is particularly useful for students and low-volume users to access foundry services without high costs.  
   **External example:** MOSIS services are widely used in academia for prototype fabrication, documented by University of Michigan (https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~mosis/)

3. **Q:** Compare the top (layout) view and cross-sectional view of an integrated circuit, including the importance of each for IC design understanding.  
   **A:** The top layout view shows the planar arrangement of layers on the chip, indicating where materials like polysilicon, metal, or diffusion regions are placed. The cross-sectional view shows a vertical slice illustrating layer thickness, sequence, and how the device layers are built up physically. Understanding both views is vital; layout guides fabrication, while cross-sections help understand parasitic effects and device operation within the substrate.  
   **External example:** Cadence’s IC layout tutorials illustrate the importance of correlating layout and cross-section views for correct transistor fabrication (https://www.cadence.com/en_US/home/tools/ic-packaging-and-pcb-design/ic-packaging-and-pcb-design-resources/ic-layout.html)

4. **Q:** What are the historical origins of CMOS technology, and why has CMOS remained the dominant technology for IC fabrication?  
   **A:** CMOS technology was invented in 1963 by Frank Wanlass, using complementary NMOS and PMOS transistors. Its dominance arises from advantages including small layout area, high operating speeds with low power dissipation, manufacturability with low defect rates, and cost-effectiveness due to device scaling (Moore’s law). CMOS’s versatility and scalability ensure it remains the standard technology for ICs for decades.  
   **External example:** The IEEE history on semiconductor technologies confirms CMOS remains dominant due to scaling and power efficiency (https://ethw.org/CMOS_and_Its_Dominance_in_Semiconductors)

5. **Q:** Discuss the shift and challenges in using CMOS technology for analog and mixed-signal IC design, emphasizing the importance of transistor matching.  
   **A:** Originally used for digital circuits, CMOS is now employed in analog and mixed-signal designs to lower costs and increase integration. A key challenge is transistor matching, referring to how closely electrical characteristics of supposedly identical devices correspond. Mismatches limit accuracy and performance, critically affecting functions like sensing and analog processing.  
   **External example:** Analog Devices highlights transistor matching as critical for precision analog CMOS ICs (https://www.analog.com/en/education/education-library/an-introduction-to-precision-matched-transistors.html)

6. **Q:** Outline the basic syntax and functionality of SPICE simulations as introduced in the document, including operating point and transfer function analyses.  
   **A:** SPICE uses a text-based netlist file to simulate circuits. Voltage sources begin with “V,” resistors with “R,” and commands with “.” (e.g., .op for operating point). Operating point analysis calculates voltages and currents at steady state. Transfer function analysis (.tf) computes ratios like gain, input, and output impedances by defining output and input nodes or currents. Netlists can include comments starting with “*” and rely on node naming conventions.  
   **External example:** The UC Berkeley SPICE tutorial provides examples and explanations consistent with the described syntax and analyses (https://bwrcs.eecs.berkeley.edu/Classes/IcDesign/spice.html)

7. **Q:** Explain how voltage-controlled voltage sources (VCVS) and voltage-controlled current sources (VCCS) are modeled in SPICE and how these models can implement ideal circuit elements such as op-amps.  
   **A:** In SPICE, VCVS elements are named starting with “E” and have a gain multiplying the controlling voltage between two nodes to produce an output voltage difference. VCCS elements start with “G,” where the controlling voltage modulates an output current. Ideal op-amps can be modeled by a VCCS with high transconductance combined with a resistor to produce a large voltage gain with infinite input resistance and low output resistance. Such modeling improves simulation convergence.  
   **External example:** The official Berkeley SPICE user's guide explains using E and G elements to simulate ideal op-amps (https://bwrcs.eecs.berkeley.edu/Classes/IcDesign/spice.html)

8. **Q:** Describe the use and structure of subcircuits in SPICE simulation, including their role in circuit reuse and the syntax for defining and invoking them.  
   **A:** Subcircuits group a set of circuit elements into a modular block for reuse, named with an “X” prefix in the main netlist call. They are defined with .subckt followed by the subcircuit name and node definitions and ended by .ends. Subcircuits allow the representation of complex components (e.g., op-amps) once, then called multiple times with different node connections in the main netlist, improving organization and simulation efficiency.  
   **External example:** The LTspice user's manual demonstrates subcircuit use extensively for reusable component simulations (https://www.analog.com/en/design-center/design-tools-and-calculators/ltspice-simulator.html)

9. **Q:** In the example resistive divider simulation, what values did SPICE output for node voltages and branch currents, and how does this illustrate SPICE’s analysis conventions?  
   **A:** For a 1 V input dividing through 1k and 2k resistors, SPICE output node voltages of 1.0 V and approximately 0.6667 V at nodes 1 and 2, respectively, and a current of -333 µA through the input voltage source. The negative current signifies flow from the positive to negative terminal of the voltage source, illustrating SPICE’s sign conventions and the accuracy of circuit analysis in steady state.  
   **External example:** The University of Minnesota SPICE tutorial on DC operating point analysis shows similar output for voltage dividers (http://stewart-ic.ee.umn.edu/ben/spice_in28mins.html)

10. **Q:** How is a DC sweep analysis performed in SPICE, and what information can be obtained from such a simulation?  
    **A:** A DC sweep (.dc command) systematically varies a circuit source voltage or current over a range and evaluates node voltages and branch currents at each step. This provides insight into the transfer characteristics and nonlinear behavior, such as voltage gain or threshold voltages, by plotting output versus input. The example shows sweeping Vin from 0 to 1 V in 1 mV steps and plotting Vout to confirm expected behavior of a voltage divider.  
    **External example:** The National Instruments LabVIEW SPICE integration tutorial explains DC sweeps to characterize circuits over input ranges (https://www.ni.com/en-us/innovations/white-papers/06/spice-simulation-in-labview.html)

The chapter discusses the design, compensation, and performance considerations of two-stage operational amplifiers (op-amps), including techniques such as Miller and indirect compensation to improve stability and bandwidth, as well as gain-enhancement methods to increase low-frequency gain. It also covers practical op-amp applications like voltage regulators, highlights slew-rate limitations, and explores advanced topologies like folded-cascode OTAs and multi-stage op-amps for achieving high gain, wide input common-mode range, and driving various load conditions.

Operational amplifiers (op-amps) are fundamental analog building blocks characterized by stages including a differential amplifier, gain stage, and output buffer, with design focusing on specification, device sizing, biasing, and compensation for stability, gain, input/output range, current capability, and power dissipation. Two-stage op-amps without output buffers drive capacitive loads but have stability and slew-rate limitations addressed through compensation methods like Miller compensation and indirect feedback, while advanced topologies, such as folded-cascode OTAs with gain enhancement and multi-stage op-amps, improve gain, bandwidth, and input common-mode range, with careful design required for output stage biasing, compensation, and stability under varying loads.

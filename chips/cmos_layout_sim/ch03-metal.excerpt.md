The chapter discusses the metal layers in CMOS integrated circuits, focusing on their layout, associated parasitic capacitances and resistances, crosstalk, ground bounce, and design considerations such as electromigration and bonding pad construction. It provides detailed examples and guidelines for estimating parasitic effects, designing metal interconnects with proper sizing and spacing, and mitigating signal integrity issues through layout techniques and decoupling capacitors.

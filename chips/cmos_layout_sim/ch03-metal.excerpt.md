The metal layers in CMOS integrated circuits, typically aluminum or copper, connect various circuit elements and involve parasitic capacitances, sheet resistance, and electromigration considerations, with bonding pads serving as critical interfaces to the outside world. Design and layout of these layers require careful attention to parasitic effects, current-carrying limitations, spacing rules, and mitigation of issues such as crosstalk and ground bounce to ensure reliable circuit performance.

1. **Q:** Explain the impact of die size reduction on chip yield and cost per die as discussed in the document.  
   **A:** Reducing the die size increases the number of die that fit on a wafer and decreases the total number of defective die lost due to defects, thereby increasing the number of good die and the yield (good die/total die). Since the processing cost per wafer is relatively constant, increasing the number of die per wafer decreases the cost per die, making smaller die economically favorable.  
   **External example:** A 2018 IEEE Transactions on Semiconductor Manufacturing paper discusses how smaller dies produce higher yield and reduce cost per chip, aligning with this concept. https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8378344

2. **Q:** What are the key general guidelines for standard-cell design in VLSI layout as outlined in the text?  
   **A:** The guidelines include: (1) Cell inputs and outputs should be vertically aligned at the same relative horizontal distance on the top and bottom of cells; (2) Power and ground buses run horizontally supplying the entire cell, with well and substrate tie-downs underneath; (3) Cells should have a constant height to ensure power and ground buses align when cells abut, with width minimized but adjustable; (4) Layouts should be labeled for power, ground, and IO connections including cell outlines for alignment.  
   **External example:** The University of California, Berkeley’s EECS course notes outline similar standard cell design rules for routability and manufacturability. https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs250/sp17/pdf/Lecture5-StdCell.pdf

3. **Q:** Describe the challenges and solutions related to power and ground distribution in VLSI layout as presented in the document.  
   **A:** Improper power and ground distribution causes noise coupling via inductive and capacitive effects, injecting unwanted signals across circuits. To mitigate this, spacing between power/ground conductors is increased to reduce coupling, or decoupling capacitors are placed within standard cell rows to increase capacitance between power and ground. On signal buses, coupling is reduced by routing adjacent wires in staggered segments to limit the length over which they are parallel.  
   **External example:** The IBM Journal of Research and Development discusses similar decoupling capacitor structures and spacing techniques for reducing power grid noise in microprocessors. https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1262216

4. **Q:** Compare the layout density and design time trade-offs between standard-cell and full-custom VLSI layout approaches as detailed in the text.  
   **A:** Standard-cell layouts have fixed height and variable width cells, placed side-by-side with routing channels between rows, yielding a density (~5,000 transistors/mm² in the example) and fast design times using automated tools. Full-custom layout, optimized for minimum area with flexible cell dimensions and abutment, achieves much higher density (~17,500 transistors/mm² in the example) and better performance but requires far longer manual design effort. Automatic place-and-route tools combining both approaches aim to balance density and efficiency.  
   **External example:** Synopsys white papers on ASIC design discuss the trade-offs between standard-cell and full-custom implementations reflecting this density and productivity balance. https://www.synopsys.com/implementation-and-signoff/full-custom-layout.html

5. **Q:** What is the significance of stick diagrams in the VLSI layout process as explained by Dean Moriarty in the document?  
   **A:** Stick diagrams serve as an early-stage, paper-and-pencil planning tool representing devices and interconnects with colored lines and symbols. They help visualize the general arrangement, detect routing problems before detailed layout, and allow designers to optimize device placement and signal routing, reducing wasted layout effort downstream. Changes in device orientation or partitioning (e.g., splitting transistor widths) can be planned effectively with stick diagrams.  
   **External example:** The MIT OpenCourseWare on VLSI CAD describes stick diagrams as essential layout planning tools in physical design stages. https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-374-analysis-and-design-of-digital-integrated-circuits-spring-2003/pages/lecture-notes/

6. **Q:** Explain how “unbroken line” device placement improves layout quality and wiring complexity in VLSI as presented in the document.  
   **A:** Arranging devices so that the active region (diffusion or n+/p+ area) is continuous without breaks simplifies wiring, particularly for signal crossing and clock distribution. It reduces routing complexity and makes hook-up signals easier to connect, as illustrated by rearranging the dynamic register cell devices to avoid breaks in active areas and to facilitate clock signal routing.  
   **External example:** From the text "CMOS IC Layout Concepts," continuous diffusion lines are emphasized for easier fabrication and lower parasitic resistance. https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5382530

7. **Q:** Discuss the rationale and layout technique for splitting large transistors into parallel stripes in VLSI design.  
   **A:** When transistor widths exceed practical maximums (e.g., poly gate max width due to resistance and RC delays), the transistor is divided into smaller parallel devices laid out as “stripes” sharing the output node. This preserves electrical characteristics while maintaining manageable gate widths, reduces parasitic effects, and optimizes layout area and routing. The output is taken in metal2 to minimize capacitance.  
   **External example:** The textbook "CMOS VLSI Design" by Weste and Harris discusses transistor segmentation for improved speed and layout compactness. https://www.pearson.com/us/higher-education/program/Weste-Principles-of-CMOS-VLSI-Design-4th-Edition/PGM282086.html

8. **Q:** What layout considerations and interconnect strategies are described for implementing carry chain logic in full-custom VLSI adder cells?  
   **A:** Carry signals are provided on cell edges (left and right) allowing cells to be abutted such that carry-out of one cell connects directly to carry-in of the next, minimizing wiring length and parasitic capacitance. Cell height and width are contextual, adapted to neighbors’ sizing to optimize area. Inputs and outputs are arranged so that signals route vertically or horizontally with minimal crossover, enabling high density and efficient carry propagation.  
   **External example:** The IEEE Transactions on VLSI Systems article on carry chain optimization discusses cell abutment strategies for fast adders. https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1245837

9. **Q:** How do design and routing approaches differ between the gated array, standard-cell, and full-custom VLSI methodologies based on the document?  
   **A:** Gate-array designs involve prefabricated arrays with limited customization allowing low design knowledge and fast time-to-market but lower density; standard-cell design connects pre-designed cells with fixed dimensions and predictable layout patterns, balancing design effort with performance; full-custom design involves creating transistor-level layouts optimized for area and speed but demanding detailed knowledge and longer design time. The chapter focuses mostly on standard-cell and full-custom techniques.  
   **External example:** The textbook "Introduction to VLSI Systems" describes these methodologies and their trade-offs. https://dl.acm.org/doi/book/10.5555/577182

10. **Q:** Summarize the layout techniques used to reduce signal coupling on buses in VLSI as explained in the document.  
    **A:** Signal coupling is minimized by reducing the parallel run-length of adjacent conductors; routing wires in staggered or zigzag patterns breaks alignment and reduces capacitive and inductive coupling areas. Additionally, spacing wires farther apart where possible and using shielding lines or decoupling capacitors can further reduce noise coupling on buses.  
    **External example:** The IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility outlines similar bus interconnect techniques for crosstalk mitigation. https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1176142

1. **Q:** What are the primary differences between metallurgical grade silicon (MGS) and electronic grade silicon (EGS), and why is EGS necessary for CMOS fabrication?  
   **A:** MGS is approximately 98% pure silicon obtained by reducing silica in an arc furnace but contains impurities at levels unsuitable for microelectronic applications, as even ppm-level impurities affect semiconductor properties like carrier mobility and lifetime. EGS is produced by chlorination of MGS, forming liquid silane and trichlorosilane, which are purified by fractional distillation and chemical reduction, yielding ultrapure polycrystalline silicon necessary for high-quality CMOS fabrication.

2. **Q:** Explain the role of thermal oxidation in CMOS fabrication, the difference between dry and wet oxidation, and how oxidation rate and oxide quality are influenced by process conditions.  
   **A:** Thermal oxidation grows a silicon dioxide (SiO2) layer on silicon wafers, used as a high-quality dielectric and implantation/diffusion/etch mask. Dry oxidation uses O2, producing denser, higher quality oxide but at slower rates. Wet oxidation uses H2O vapor, yielding faster oxidation but less dense oxide. Oxidation rate depends on temperature, oxidant type, gas partial pressures, silicon doping, and crystallography; it may be diffusion-limited (thick oxides) or reaction-rate limited (thin oxides). Approximately 45% of grown oxide thickness consumes silicon.

3. **Q:** Describe the ion implantation process, including how implant profiles are formed and masked, and contrast it against solid state diffusion in doping CMOS devices.  
   **A:** Ion implantation introduces dopants by ionizing atoms and accelerating them into the wafer, yielding a Gaussian doping profile with peak concentration at the projected range and standard deviation (straggle). Masks of sufficient thickness (oxide, nitride, polysilicon, photoresist) block unwanted implantation. It is a low-temperature, precisely controlled process but causes lattice damage requiring annealing for electrical activation and repair. Solid state diffusion redistributes dopants thermally post-implant via concentration gradients, causing lateral and vertical spreading ("thermal smearing") which must be managed to maintain device dimensions.

4. **Q:** How does photolithography enable patterning in CMOS fabrication, and what are the trade-offs involved in stepper resolution, depth of focus, and registration accuracy?  
   **A:** Photolithography localizes processing by patterning a photoresist layer using ultraviolet (UV) light through masks with precise alignment. Resolution (minimum feature size) depends on UV wavelength and numerical aperture (NA) of optics, governed by diffraction limits; decreasing features compromises depth of focus (DOF) inversely proportional to NA². Registration accuracy ensures multi-layer alignment critical for device functionality; errors can be in x-y translations or rotations affecting circuit integrity. Optimization balances smallest printable features with planarization (improving DOF) and precise alignment techniques.

5. **Q:** Differentiate the unit processes of thin-film removal in CMOS fabrication, including wet etching, dry etching (sputter, plasma, RIE), and chemical mechanical polishing (CMP), emphasizing their selectivity, anisotropy, and typical applications.  
   **A:** Wet etching uses chemical solutions, tends to be isotropic with high selectivity, suitable for cleaning and bulk removal but limited in fine features. Dry etching includes sputter etching (physical ion bombardment, highly anisotropic, low selectivity), plasma etching (chemical reaction with radicals, isotropic, high selectivity), and reactive ion etching (RIE) combining both physical and chemical effects, offering high anisotropy and selectivity, preferred for submicron features. CMP combines chemical slurry and mechanical abrasion to planarize surfaces critical for photolithographic precision, removing topography and improving subsequent layer quality.

6. **Q:** Outline the physical vapor deposition (PVD) and chemical vapor deposition (CVD) techniques for thin film deposition in CMOS fabrication, including the impact on film step coverage and uniformity.  
   **A:** PVD (evaporation and sputtering) physically transfers atoms/molecules in vapor form to the substrate, often yielding poor step coverage and limited conformality, suitable for metals and some semiconductors/insulators. CVD introduces reactive gases that chemically deposit films at substrate surface, producing highly conformal, uniform films with better step coverage; variants include atmospheric (APCVD), low pressure (LPCVD), and plasma-enhanced (PECVD) enabling lower temperature depositions. CVD is preferred for deposition on complex topographies and for gap-filling high aspect ratio features.

7. **Q:** Describe the sequence and integration of major frontend-of-the-line (FEOL) modules in CMOS process flow, focusing on their purpose, key steps, and the interaction between the shallow trench isolation (STI), twin-tub wells, gate, and source/drain modules.  
   **A:** FEOL integrates unit processes forming isolated CMOS transistors. STI module creates dielectric isolation trenches filled with oxide, employing pad oxide and nitride masks for trench etching, liner growth, and CMP planarization to minimize leakage and encroachment. Twin-tub wells are formed by patterned p-well and n-well implantation for NMOS and PMOS regions, respectively. The gate module removes sacrificial oxides, grows gate dielectric, deposits polysilicon gates (defining gate lengths), and forms sidewall oxide. The source/drain module implants low-doped extension regions self-aligned with gates, deposits spacer nitride films, then implants heavily doped source/drain regions, finalized by annealing to activate dopants. The modules are interdependent, with careful control ensuring device performance and feature dimensions.

8. **Q:** Explain the backend-of-the-line (BEOL) integration process in CMOS fabrication, emphasizing the sequence of salicide formation, pre-metal dielectric deposition, contacts/vias formation, metallization, and passivation, including the purpose of each step.  
   **A:** BEOL forms electrical interconnections post-transistor fabrication. Salicide formation lowers polysilicon and silicon contact resistance by selective metal silicide formed via sputtering of Ti or Co, low-temperature anneal, etching unreacted metal, and high-temperature anneal. Pre-metal dielectric (PMD) insulates metals and polysilicon, planarized by CMP for lithographic precision. Contact openings are etched through PMD and nitride stop layers, filled with Ti/TiN liners and tungsten deposited by CVD, planarized by CMP. Metallization (Al-based metal1 stack) is sputter deposited and patterned by photolithography and etching, followed by high-density plasma dielectric deposition and CMP. Vias are similarly formed and filled with tungsten to interconnect metal layers. Finally, passivation layers protect circuits mechanically and chemically, with bond pad openings for packaging.

9. **Q:** What are the considerations and procedures involved in wafer probe and yield analysis after CMOS fabrication, and how do in-line parametric tests contribute to process control?  
   **A:** Wafer probe tests parametric structures and devices on wafer or scribe lines at various fabrication stages to measure parameters like contact resistance, sheet resistance, threshold voltage, and current characteristics, enabling early process feedback and scrap decisions. Final wafer probe after passivation tests circuit functionality with test vectors identifying failed die. Yield is computed as the ratio of passing die to total die. Parametric in-line tests allow early detection of process deviations reducing costs and improving quality control by halting unsuitable wafers from continuing in the process flow.

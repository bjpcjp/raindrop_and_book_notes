This chapter focuses on the design and operation of semiconductor memory circuits, particularly random access memories (RAM), including array architectures, sensing techniques, peripheral circuits, and various types of memory cells such as DRAM, SRAM, ROM, EPROM, EEPROM, and Flash memory. Key aspects covered include bit line capacitance, sense amplifier design and operation, memory cell layouts, array architectures to minimize noise and maximize density, and programming and erasing mechanisms in floating gate memories using techniques like channel hot-electron injection and Fowler-Nordheim tunneling.

This chapter discusses the design and operation of semiconductor random access memory (RAM) circuits, focusing on memory array architectures, sensing techniques, peripheral circuits such as sense amplifiers and row drivers, and different types of memory cells including DRAM, SRAM, ROM, and floating gate memories like EPROM and Flash. Key aspects include optimizing bit line capacitance, managing noise and power in sense amplifiers, decoding address lines, driving word lines above supply voltage, and programming and erasing non-volatile memories through mechanisms such as channel hot-electron injection and Fowler-Nordheim tunneling.

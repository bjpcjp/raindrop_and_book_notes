- **Body Effect** — The increase in MOSFET threshold voltage caused by a non-zero source-to-bulk voltage.
- **Channel Length Modulation (λ)** — Variation of MOSFET drain current with drain-to-source voltage in saturation, modeled as an output conductance.
- **Cutoff Region** — MOSFET operating region where gate-source voltage is below threshold, ideally no drain current.
- **Drain Current (ID)** — The current flowing from the drain terminal of a MOSFET.
- **Drain-Source Voltage (VDS)** — Voltage difference between the drain and source terminals of a MOSFET.
- **Gate-Drain Connected MOSFET (Diode-Connected)** — A MOSFET configuration with gate and drain tied together, operating always in saturation with fixed VGS=VDS.
- **Gate-Source Voltage (VGS)** — Voltage difference between the gate and source terminals of a MOSFET.
- **Input-Referred Noise** — The equivalent noise voltage or current referred back to the input of a device for comparison with the signal.
- **Long-Channel MOSFET** — A MOSFET with channel length typically >1 μm that follows square-law behavior.
- **Mobility (μ)** — The velocity of charge carriers in a semiconductor per unit electric field.
- **Open-Circuit Gain (gmr0)** — The product of MOSFET transconductance and output resistance, representing voltage gain.
- **Output Resistance (ro)** — The equivalent small-signal resistance looking into the drain of a MOSFET in saturation.
- **Overdrive Voltage (Vov or VGS - VTH)** — The difference between gate-source voltage and threshold voltage; also called gate overdrive.
- **PMOS** — A MOSFET type using p-type channel; positive voltage applied to source relative to bulk.
- **Small-Signal Transconductance (gm)** — The rate of change of drain current with gate-source voltage for small AC signals.
- **Short-Channel MOSFET** — A MOSFET with channel length typically <1 μm exhibiting non-square-law behavior and velocity saturation.
- **Subthreshold Region** — Operating region of a MOSFET where gate voltage is below threshold but weak inversion current flows.
- **Threshold Voltage (VTH)** — The minimum gate-source voltage required to form a conducting channel in a MOSFET.
- **Transconductance Parameter (KP)** — A MOSFET device parameter combining mobility and oxide capacitance per unit area.
- **Transition Frequency (fT)** — The frequency at which a MOSFET's current gain drops to unity; indicates speed of the device.
- **Triode Region (Linear Region)** — MOSFET operating region where the device behaves like a voltage-controlled resistor.
- **Velocity Saturation** — Phenomenon in short-channel MOSFETs where carrier velocity saturates at high electric fields, limiting current.
- **White Noise (Thermal Noise)** — Noise with flat spectral density caused by thermal agitation of charge carriers.
- **1/f Noise (Flicker Noise)** — Low-frequency noise caused by charge trapping and release at the semiconductor-oxide interface.
- **Workfunction** — The energy needed to remove an electron from the material surface, relevant for gate material and threshold voltage.

This chapter covers special-purpose CMOS circuits, including the design and applications of Schmitt triggers for noise-immune signal shaping and oscillators, multivibrators for timing and pulse generation, input buffers for clean digital signal regeneration, and on-chip voltage generators such as charge pumps for producing voltages beyond the supply range. Detailed analyses, design examples, and considerations for performance optimization and practical implementation, including controlling hysteresis, managing load effects, and substrate bias generation, are provided to facilitate high-speed, reliable CMOS circuit design.

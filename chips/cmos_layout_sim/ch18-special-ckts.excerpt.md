This chapter covers special-purpose CMOS circuits including the Schmitt trigger for pulse shaping and oscillators, monostable and astable multivibrators for timing applications, input buffers for signal regeneration in high-speed designs, and on-chip voltage generators such as charge pumps for producing voltages beyond the supply range or negative substrate bias. Detailed design principles, circuit operation analyses, and practical considerations like hysteresis, propagation delays, and sizing are provided alongside examples and simulations illustrating these fundamental analog and mixed-signal building blocks.

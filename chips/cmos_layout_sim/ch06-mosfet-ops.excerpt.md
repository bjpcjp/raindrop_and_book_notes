This chapter provides a detailed overview of MOSFET operation, including the definition of voltages, currents, and capacitances in different regions—accumulation, depletion, and strong inversion—and derives their large-signal current-voltage characteristics with applications in SPICE modeling. It also addresses short-channel effects, body effect, threshold voltage adjustments, and modern device considerations such as velocity saturation, hot carriers, and reliability issues, supported by examples and parameters for long- and short-channel CMOS processes.

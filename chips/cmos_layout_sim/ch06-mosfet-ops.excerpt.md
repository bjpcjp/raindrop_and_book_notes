This chapter details the operation of MOSFETs, covering voltage and current conventions, capacitances in different operating regions (accumulation, depletion, strong inversion), threshold voltage derivation including body effect, and the large-signal current-voltage characteristics in triode and saturation regions. It also discusses short-channel effects such as velocity saturation, body effect, and reliability concerns, providing SPICE model parameters and examples for both long- and short-channel CMOS processes.

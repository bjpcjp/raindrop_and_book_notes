- **ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter)** — A circuit that converts analog signals into digital numbers, used in sensing applications.  
- **Amplifier, Sense** — A device that compares signal levels to determine if one is higher than another.  
- **Bucket (Sigma Bucket)** — A conceptual storage device that accumulates differences (noise or signal) over time in DSM.  
- **Capacitor, Hold** — A capacitor used to store sampled analog voltages temporarily in imaging sensors.  
- **Charge Feedback** — A technique in DSM where a known amount of charge is added or removed to maintain a voltage level.  
- **Clocked Comparator** — A comparator that makes decisions synchronized to a clock signal, often in DSM circuits.  
- **Clock Frequency** — The rate at which a clock cycles; influences sensing resolution and bandwidth in DSM.  
- **Counter (Up Counter)** — A digital device counting the number of times an event occurs, used to average outputs in DSM.  
- **Current Mirror** — A circuit that copies a current from one branch to another, used to subtract currents in sensing circuits.  
- **Delta-Sigma Modulation (DSM)** — A sensing technique converting analog signals into a stream of pulses that, when averaged, reveal the original signal.  
- **Fowler-Nordheim Tunneling (FNT)** — A programming method in Flash memory cells replaced by direct tunneling in advanced processes.  
- **Feedback Signal** — The controlled charge or current fed back into the sensing node to stabilize and sense analog inputs precisely.  
- **Floating-Gate Memory Cell (Flash Memory)** — A non-volatile memory cell where charge storage on a gate controls transistor conduction.  
- **Incomplete Settling** — A condition where the circuit doesn’t reach its final state before the clock transitions, affecting sensing accuracy.  
- **Input-Referred Noise** — The equivalent noise level referred back to the input of a sensing circuit.  
- **Mismatch** — Variations between nominally identical components or circuit paths that cause sensing errors or image artifacts.  
- **Nonoverlapping Clocks** — Clock signals structured so they never are active at the same time, preventing short circuits in switching circuits.  
- **Nyquist Rate** — (implied) The sampling rate necessary to capture signals without aliasing, relevant to clock frequency choices.  
- **Parasitic Capacitance** — Unwanted capacitance present in a circuit node that affects charge transfer and sensing accuracy.  
- **Pixel (Active Pixel Sensor, APS)** — A pixel design for image sensors using active devices to convert light into voltage signals.  
- **Programmable Resistance** — The resistance value in resistive memory cells that can be programmed to represent stored data.  
- **Reference Voltage (Vref)** — A known voltage used as a comparison baseline in sensing circuits.  
- **Resolution** — The smallest change in input signal that can be reliably detected by the sensing system.  
- **Sample and Hold (S/H)** — A circuit that captures and holds a voltage level for conversion or processing.  
- **Sensitivity** — The ability of a sensing circuit to distinguish small changes in input signal.  
- **Sigma (Sum) Operation** — In DSM, integrating or accumulating the difference between input signal and feedback over time.  
- **Switched-Capacitor Resistor** — A circuit that emulates a resistor using capacitors and switches controlled by clock signals.  
- **Threshold Voltage (VTH)** — The voltage at which a MOS transistor begins to conduct.  
- **Voltage-to-Current Converter** — A circuit that converts a voltage signal into a proportional current, often linearly over a range.

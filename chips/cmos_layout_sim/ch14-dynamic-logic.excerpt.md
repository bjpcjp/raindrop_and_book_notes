Dynamic logic gates use the capacitive input of MOSFETs to store charge and remember logic levels, enabling decreased complexity, increased speed, and lower power dissipation, but they face design challenges due to leakage currents and require nonoverlapping clocks to avoid data corruption. Various dynamic logic styles, such as precharge-evaluate (PE), domino, and NP logic, offer trade-offs in speed, power, and complexity, with techniques like keeper transistors mitigating charge leakage to maintain signal integrity.

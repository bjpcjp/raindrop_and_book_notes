Dynamic logic gates use the capacitive input of MOSFETs to store charge and remember logic levels, enabling increased speed and lowered power dissipation but are susceptible to leakage currents that discharge the storage node, necessitating careful clock design and nonoverlapping clock generation. Precharge-evaluate (PE) and Domino logic circuits operate with clocked phases to manage charge storage and evaluation, with Domino logic adding an inverter and a keeper transistor to prevent charge leakage and ensure glitch-free cascading, while NP logic staggers NMOS and PMOS stages for higher speed operation and pipelining allows continuous processing of multi-bit additions over multiple clock cycles.

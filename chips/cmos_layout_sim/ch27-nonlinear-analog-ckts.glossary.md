- **Adaptive biasing** — A technique to reduce power dissipation in amplifiers by increasing bias current only when needed for higher output drive.
- **Analog buffer** — A circuit stage that isolates and amplifies an input signal, often used to convert analog signals to logic levels.
- **Analog multiplier** — A circuit that produces an output proportional to the product of two input voltages.
- **Body effect** — The influence of the voltage difference between a MOSFET’s body and source on its threshold voltage.
- **Clamped input stage** — A comparator input stage that prevents one side of a differential pair from turning off to maintain linear operation.
- **Common-mode voltage** — The average voltage level common to both inputs of a differential amplifier or comparator.
- **Current diff-amp** — A differential amplifier designed to produce an output proportional to the difference of two currents.
- **Decision circuit** — The positive feedback stage in a comparator that amplifies the difference between input signals to a digital output.
- **Differential amplifier (diff-amp)** — A circuit that amplifies the difference between two input voltages while rejecting common-mode signals.
- **Four-quadrant multiplier** — An analog multiplier that can handle positive and negative inputs on both signal axes.
- **Hysteresis** — A deliberate feedback mechanism that creates different switching thresholds to reject noise and prevent rapid toggling.
- **Input buffer** — A circuit that interfaces an input signal to reduce loading effects and improve signal integrity.
- **Kickback noise** — Unwanted voltage spikes at the input of a comparator caused by switching in internal feedback or output stages.
- **Long-channel MOSFET** — A MOS transistor with a channel length long enough that it approximately follows square-law behavior.
- **Minimum input slew rate** — The slowest input voltage change rate at which a comparator can reliably make a decision without metastability.
- **NMOS device** — An n-type metal-oxide-semiconductor transistor used in CMOS circuits.
- **Op-amp (operational amplifier)** — A high-gain amplifier used in analog circuits, sometimes employed as a comparator.
- **Output buffer** — The stage in a comparator that converts an internal analog output into a full digital logic level.
- **Positive feedback** — A circuit configuration where a portion of the output is fed back to the input, amplifying differences for faster switching.
- **Propagation delay** — The time it takes for a comparator’s output to respond to an input voltage crossing the threshold.
- **Rail-to-rail input** — A circuit input capable of accepting voltages that span from the lowest to the highest supply voltage.
- **Short-channel MOSFET** — A MOS transistor with a small channel length where short-channel effects alter ideal device behavior.
- **Square-law characteristic** — The relationship where MOSFET drain current varies as the square of gate-to-source voltage over threshold, valid for long-channel devices.
- **Switching point voltage (VSPH, VSPL)** — The differential input voltage at which a comparator changes output state, used to characterize hysteresis.
- **Triode region** — The MOSFET operating region where it acts like a voltage-controlled resistor rather than a transistor.
- **Voltage comparator** — A circuit that compares two input voltages and outputs a digital logic level indicating which is higher.
- **Voltage-controlled voltage source (VCVS)** — A circuit element that produces an output voltage proportional to an input voltage, often used in SPICE models.

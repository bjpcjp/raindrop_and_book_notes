Electrical noise in circuits, primarily inherent noise such as thermal, shot, and flicker noise, significantly impacts system performance and is analyzed using power spectral density and root-mean-squared voltage concepts. Understanding noise sources, modeling input-referred noise, and considering factors like bandwidth, amplifier gain, and correlation are crucial for optimizing noise performance in analog and mixed-signal CMOS designs.

Electrical noise in circuits, including inherent types like thermal, shot, and flicker noise, fundamentally limits system performance and is characterized through power spectral density and input-referred noise concepts. Accurate noise analysis involves summing mean-squared noise contributions, understanding bandwidth effects, and modeling noise sources within circuits and cascaded amplifiers to optimize signal-to-noise ratio and noise figure.

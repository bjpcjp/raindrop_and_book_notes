This chapter explains the use and layout of the active, n-select, p-select, and poly layers in forming NMOS and PMOS devices within CMOS processes, highlighting how the polysilicon gate and self-aligned implants create MOSFETs and how silicide reduces resistance in poly and active regions. It also covers connections to metal, substrate and well tie-down strategies, design rules, and electrostatic discharge (ESD) protection structures using diode clamps integrated into pad layouts.

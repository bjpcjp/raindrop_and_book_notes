This chapter explains the use of active, n-select, p-select, and poly layers in CMOS fabrication to form NMOS and PMOS devices, detailing how these layers define transistor regions, doping, and gate formation. It also covers the importance of silicide for reducing resistance, the layout of device connections and well/substrate ties, design rules, and basic electrostatic discharge (ESD) protection using diode structures.

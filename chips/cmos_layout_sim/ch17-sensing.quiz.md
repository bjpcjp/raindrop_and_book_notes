1. **Q:** Explain the principle of delta-sigma modulation (DSM) sensing using the water bucket analogy and how it improves precision compared to a single sense-amp strobe.  
   **A:** DSM sensing converts the analog signal (water height) into a flow rate by continuously adding water to a sigma bucket and removing a fixed amount (a cup) when the water exceeds a threshold. By averaging the number of cups removed over time, DSM provides a precise digital representation of the input signal despite noise or fluctuations, effectively integrating and filtering noise that would hinder single-measurement sense-amps. This averaging reduces the impact of errors and noise, allowing indefinite sensing time for improved resolution.  
   **External example:** Delta-sigma ADCs use oversampling and noise shaping to improve precision by integrating quantization errors over time, similar to the DSM sensing concept: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1179557

2. **Q:** Describe the role and critical design considerations of the feedback signal (“cup size”) in DSM sensing circuits, and the trade-offs involved.  
   **A:** The feedback signal represents the fixed amount of charge or current added back into the sigma bucket each clock cycle to balance the input signal removed. A smaller cup size allows quicker convergence and higher precision but risks bucket overflow since the system can't remove charge fast enough; larger cups cover wider dynamic ranges but require longer averaging times. The feedback signal must be constant and precise to avoid errors, and parasitic capacitances and incomplete settling can degrade accuracy.

3. **Q:** How is DSM applied for sensing current in Flash memory cells, and what limits the maximum bit line voltage excursion during sensing?  
   **A:** DSM sensing in Flash memory views the bit line capacitance as the sigma bucket, with the cell current removing charge and a current source (feedback cup) adding charge. A comparator detects when bit line voltage surpasses a threshold, controlling feedback. Charge conservation ensures average voltage stability. The maximum bit line voltage deviation is limited by the bit line capacitance, clock frequency, and feedback current; a small capacitance, high clock frequency, or large feedback current reduces voltage swing to avoid overflow or emptying.

4. **Q:** In resistive memory sensing using DSM, why is an offset voltage added to the comparator, and how does this affect the design of the switched-capacitor feedback resistor?  
   **A:** The offset voltage biases the comparator’s reference so that the sense amplifier holds the bit line voltage above zero, preventing zero feedback current when sensing large resistors. This offset sets the voltage difference across the switched-capacitor resistor used in the feedback path, defining its equivalent resistance. Proper offset ensures that current through the feedback resistor balances the cell current, enabling linear sensing of resistive states between defined minimum and maximum resistances.

5. **Q:** What are the advantages of using DSM sensing in CMOS imagers over traditional single-conversion ADCs, particularly regarding noise and dynamic range?  
   **A:** DSM sensing converts light-induced analog voltages (pixel intensities) into digital numbers by integrating the difference between a reference and measured signal currents over time, providing inherent digital noise filtering and averaging. Unlike single-ramp ADCs, DSM enables indefinite sensing duration for improved resolution and dynamic range, while minimizing noise accumulation through its averaging property. It also reduces sensitivity to comparator offset and switching glitches, improving robustness in noisy environments.

6. **Q:** Explain how input mismatch in DSM sensing circuits for CMOS imagers introduces errors and the method used to mitigate these errors.  
   **A:** Mismatch between the reference and intensity signal paths causes systematic offset errors manifested as fixed pattern noise or image streaking. To mitigate this, the DSM inputs are swapped halfway through the sensing period, averaging out mismatches. This requires corresponding switching of feedback paths and temporarily disabling the counter during switching to avoid transient errors, thus improving measurement linearity and reducing fixed pattern noise.  
   **External example:** Input offset cancellation by input swapping improves mismatch errors in delta-sigma modulators and improves image uniformity: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5639027

7. **Q:** Discuss the effect of parasitic capacitances and incomplete settling on the feedback charge in DSM sensing circuits and strategies to reduce their impact.  
   **A:** Parasitic capacitances at the output of current sources cause the feedback charge per clock to vary with bit line voltage, inducing nonlinearities and limiting precision. Incomplete settling occurs when switches disconnect before charge transfer finishes, making capacitors appear smaller and limiting dynamic range. Reducing these effects involves connecting switches to an appropriate bias voltage (e.g., VDD instead of ground), adding transistor M4 to maintain a constant voltage across feedback capacitors, increasing transistor widths, or lowering clock frequency to allow complete settling.  
   **External example:** Switched-capacitor circuits face parasitic and settling issues mitigated by careful switch timing and circuit design: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/993024

8. **Q:** How does the DSM sensing circuit for CMOS imagers convert the sampled pixel voltages into currents suitable for delta-sigma modulation, and why is current subtraction favored over voltage subtraction?  
   **A:** The sampled reference and intensity voltages are converted into proportional currents using source followers followed by switched-capacitor resistors. These currents are then subtracted using current mirrors and summed on a capacitor (the sigma bucket). Current subtraction is favored because it allows continuous-time analog integration and straightforward feedback control compatible with delta-sigma operation, whereas direct voltage subtraction is more susceptible to mismatches and nonlinearities.  
   **External example:** Current-mode sensing and subtraction is common in image sensor readout circuits to reduce offset and enhance dynamic range: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1286836

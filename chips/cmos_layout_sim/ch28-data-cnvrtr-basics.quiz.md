1. **Q:** Explain the differences between analog signals and digital signals in the context of data conversion, including how sample rate and quantization levels affect the accuracy of the digital representation.
   **A:** Analog signals are continuous in time and amplitude, having infinite resolution within their range, while digital signals are discrete in both time and amplitude, defined only at specific sampling instances and limited to quantized values. The accuracy of digital representation depends on the number of samples taken per unit time (sampling rate) and the number of quantization levels (resolution). The Nyquist Criterion requires the sampling rate to be at least twice the highest frequency in the analog signal to avoid aliasing. Increasing the number of quantization levels improves the precision of analog voltage representation, reducing approximation errors.

2. **Q:** What are the primary errors associated with a Sample-and-Hold (S/H) circuit in data conversion, and how do they impact the performance of an Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC)?
   **A:** Primary errors in S/H circuits include acquisition time during sampling (time to track input within tolerance), settling time impacted by amplifier slew rate and stability, pedestal error caused by charge injection and clock feedthrough, droop caused by leakage currents during hold mode, and aperture error (jitter) due to finite hold-command timing uncertainty. These errors cause sampling inaccuracies, limit converter speed and resolution, introduce voltage offsets, and create uncertainty in timing leading to quantization errors during ADC operation.

3. **Q:** Define Differential Nonlinearity (DNL) and Integral Nonlinearity (INL) for both DACs and ADCs, and describe how these errors affect data converter accuracy and monotonicity.
   **A:** DNL measures the deviation of each actual code width (increment between output levels) from the ideal code width (1 LSB). For DACs, DNL is the difference between adjacent output voltage steps; for ADCs, it is the difference between actual and ideal input voltage ranges associated with output codes. INL measures the deviation of the actual transfer curve from a best-fit straight line connecting the extreme codes. Large DNL (> ±1 LSB) in DACs causes missing codes and nonmonotonic outputs, which entails that output does not always increase with input code. INL affects overall linearity and accuracy, impacting signal fidelity.

4. **Q:** How is Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) related to ADC resolution, and how can the effective number of bits (ENOB) be determined from a given SNR?
   **A:** The SNR of an ideal ADC is approximately SNR = 6.02N + 1.76 dB, where N is the number of bits of resolution. This equation relates the quantization noise inherent in the ADC to the bit resolution. Given an actual measured SNR, the effective number of bits can be calculated by rearranging the formula: ENOB = (SNR - 1.76) / 6.02. This indicates how much of the nominal bit resolution is effectively usable considering noise and distortion.

5. **Q:** Describe the phenomenon of aliasing in the context of ADC sampling, including the conditions that lead to it and the techniques employed to prevent it.
   **A:** Aliasing occurs when an analog signal is sampled below the Nyquist Rate—less than twice the highest frequency component of the signal—causing higher frequency components to be indistinguishably mapped to lower frequencies in the digital output. To prevent aliasing, two primary techniques are employed: (1) sampling at a rate at least twice the highest frequency component, and (2) pre-sampling low-pass (anti-aliasing) filtering to remove frequency components above half the sampling rate.
   **External example:** The National Instruments documentation on ADC measurements explains aliasing and prevention by anti-aliasing filters and sufficient sampling rates. https://www.ni.com/en-us/innovations/white-papers/06/data-acquisition-basics--sampling-and-aliasing.html

6. **Q:** What layout strategies are crucial for mixed-signal IC design to reduce noise coupling between digital and analog circuits, and why is floorplanning important?
   **A:** Crucial layout strategies include segregating sensitive low-level analog signals from digital signals via floorplanning that places noisy digital output drivers away from sensitive inputs, providing separate power and ground routing with dedicated pads or pins, using guard rings connected to analog/digital ground, employing shielding layers or dummy metal shields between analog and digital lines, and utilizing fully differential amplifier designs for common-mode noise rejection. Floorplanning enables effective physical separation of signals and optimization of wiring to minimize noise coupling, interference through substrate, and power supply contamination.
   **External example:** IEEE’s mixed-signal IC design guides emphasize floorplanning and shielding techniques to enhance signal integrity and noise immunity. https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5578934

7. **Q:** How are offset and gain errors defined for DACs and ADCs, and what are the visual manifestations of these errors on transfer curves?
   **A:** Offset error is the displacement of the transfer curve from zero output when the input code is zero for a DAC or the first code transition for an ADC, effectively a vertical shift. Gain error is the difference between the actual slope of the transfer curve and ideal slope, appearing as a scaling error causing the output range to be compressed or expanded. On transfer curves, offset error shifts the entire curve up or down, while gain error changes the slope of the line fitting the output values.
   **External example:** Analog Devices explains offset and gain errors with graphical illustrations in their data converter whitepapers. https://www.analog.com/en/analog-dialogue/raqs/raq-issue-82.html

8. **Q:** Explain the concept of dynamic range in data converters and how it relates mathematically to resolution.
   **A:** Dynamic range is the ratio between the largest and smallest output signals that a data converter can accurately process, typically expressed in decibels (dB). For an N-bit converter, the dynamic range is approximately DR = 20·log₁₀(2ᴺ - 1) ≈ 6.02N dB. This expresses that each additional bit in resolution doubles the number of quantization levels and increases the dynamic range by about 6 dB.
   **External example:** Texas Instruments documents dynamic range concepts related to ADCs and DACs showing the correlation between bit resolution and dynamic range. https://www.ti.com/lit/an/snoa725/snoa725.pdf

1. **Q:** Describe the complete CMOS IC design process as outlined in the document, including how circuit inputs and outputs, parasitics, and layout considerations interact throughout the stages.
   **A:** The CMOS IC design process begins with defining circuit inputs and outputs (circuit specifications), followed by hand calculations and schematics, circuit simulations, and layout. After layout, simulations including parasitics (stray capacitances, inductances, junctions, bipolar transistors) are performed to reevaluate circuit performance. Based on simulation results, inputs and outputs may be readjusted before prototype fabrication and testing. The process is iterative until the circuit meets specifications, after which production proceeds. Understanding parasitics and providing guidance on layout is crucial, particularly for precision and high-speed designs.

2. **Q:** Explain how SPICE treats node voltages and currents in operating point (.op) simulations and the significance of positive current direction conventions in SPICE netlists.
   **A:** In operating point simulations, SPICE calculates and lists node voltages and loop currents at steady state. Node voltages are referenced to ground (node 0), and current through voltage sources is defined as positive when flowing from their positive terminal to the negative terminal. Hence, a negative current implies flow opposite to this direction. This convention affects interpretation of currents in simulations, such as the example of a voltage divider where the supply current was negative indicating direction.

3. **Q:** How does the document define the CMOS acronym evolution, and why has the terminology shifted from metal gates to polysilicon gates in modern devices?
   **A:** Originally, CMOS referred to devices with metal gates and connections to the MOSFET body, as in Wanlass’s patent. Modern devices use polysilicon gates instead of metal, making the more accurate term CPOS (complementary-polysilicon-oxide-semiconductor). Despite this, the terms MOSFET and CMOS prevail as standard nomenclature. The acronym IFET or IGFET is also used but less common.

4. **Q:** Discuss how MOSIS facilitates fabrication of CMOS ICs designed by engineers and students, including the concept and benefits of multiproject wafers.
   **A:** MOSIS enables fabrication of CMOS ICs by combining multiple small chip designs from various sources onto a single multiproject wafer, which is then processed by commercial vendors. This sharing reduces fabrication costs for low-volume or educational projects. After fabrication, MOSIS separates and packages each chip design individually before return to the originator. This method democratizes access to chip fabrication.

5. **Q:** What are the typical reasons that circuit specifications evolve throughout the CMOS design process, and why are major changes after production usually impossible?
   **A:** Circuit specifications often change due to trade-offs between cost and performance, shifts in chip marketability, or customer needs during development. However, after chip production begins, major changes aren’t feasible because fabrication masks and processes are fixed and expensive to alter, making redesign cost-prohibitive and time-consuming.

6. **Q:** Explain how the document describes the modeling of an ideal op-amp using a voltage-controlled current source (VCCS) in SPICE, including its advantage over a voltage-controlled voltage source (VCVS).
   **A:** An ideal op-amp in SPICE can be modeled using a VCCS that multiplies the input voltage difference by a transconductance (gain) to produce an output current. This model generally improves simulation convergence over VCVS implementations. The input resistance at the op-amp input nodes is infinite, and the load resistor converts output current to voltage.
   **External example:** The UC Berkeley EECS lecture notes on SPICE modeling recommend VCCS models for high-gain op-amps due to numerical stability. https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~ee40/spice.pdf

7. **Q:** What are the functions and uses of the .tf, .op, .dc, and .ac analysis commands in SPICE as described in the text, and how do they differ in the type of output they generate?
   **A:** 
   - .op computes the circuit’s operating point, providing node voltages and branch currents at DC steady state. No graphical output.
   - .tf (transfer function) calculates transfer characteristics such as gain and input/output impedance between defined input and output nodes.
   - .dc performs a DC sweep of a source parameter over a range, generating data for plotting output voltage/current versus input voltage/current.
   - .ac computes frequency responses of circuits by sweeping frequency over a range, yielding magnitude and phase plots. 
   Each offers different insights into circuit behavior.

8. **Q:** How does the document define and calculate the quality factor (Q) of an LC tank, and what SPICE method is used to determine its value?
   **A:** The quality factor Q is defined as the ratio of the resonant (center) frequency to the bandwidth between the 3 dB points of the LC tank’s frequency response. In SPICE, an AC analysis is run plotting output magnitude versus frequency, with linear frequency steps. The center frequency and 3 dB frequencies are extracted from the curve, and Q is calculated using Q = fcenter / (f3dB_high – f3dB_low).
   **External example:** The IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems explains Q measurement by bandwidth method for resonant circuits. https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4063195

9. **Q:** Discuss the role and impact of tolerances (ABSTOL, VNTOL, RELTOL) in SPICE simulations and how adjusting them affects convergence and accuracy.
   **A:** ABSTOL (absolute current tolerance), VNTOL (node voltage tolerance), and RELTOL (relative tolerance) set thresholds for numerical convergence in SPICE simulations. Larger tolerance values speed simulation and help convergence by allowing less precise results; smaller values improve accuracy but may cause convergence failure. RELTOL helps manage simulations spanning wide voltage ranges by setting relative error limits. Adjusting these is a common remedy for simulation convergence issues.

10. **Q:** How do the pulse and piece-wise linear (PWL) source statements differ in SPICE transient simulations, and what are typical uses for each according to the document?
    **A:** Pulse sources generate square waves or clock signals characterized by initial/final voltages, delays, rise/fall times, pulse width, and period, suitable for simulating repetitive signal transitions with well-defined timing. PWL sources specify arbitrary waveforms as series of time-voltage points with linear interpolation, useful for complex or non-periodic input shapes. Both are used in transient analyses but serve different waveform generation needs.

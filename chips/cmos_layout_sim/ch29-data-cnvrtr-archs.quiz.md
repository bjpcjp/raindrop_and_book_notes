1. **Q:** What are the primary advantages and limitations of resistor-string DAC architectures, and how do resistor mismatch and power dissipation affect their resolution limits?  
   **A:** Resistor-string DACs are simple and inherently monotonic, offering good accuracy if resistor values are tightly matched and output current is negligible. They use 2^N resistors and an N:2^N decoder, causing increased parasitic capacitance and slower conversion speeds for high resolutions. Power dissipation is always present because current continuously flows through the resistor ladder; reducing resistor size decreases area but increases power. Mismatch errors directly affect integral nonlinearity (INL); for example, a 2% tolerance limits resolution to about 5 bits, while 0.2% tolerance can allow up to 9 bits. INL is proportional to resistor mismatch times 2^N, making resistor matching critical for high-resolution designs.  
   **External example:** Resistor-string DACs are used in integrated circuits where monotonicity is crucial, but their power and area scale poorly with resolution (Analog Devices, Resistor String DAC Basics: https://www.analog.com/en/analog-dialogue/articles/resistor-string-dacs-basics.html).

2. **Q:** Describe the operation and main challenges of current-steering DACs and explain how current source mismatches impact their INL and DNL. How does the architecture differ between thermometer-coded and binary-weighted current-steering DACs in terms of complexity and accuracy requirements?  
   **A:** Current-steering DACs use multiple precision current sources switched according to digital input to steer currents to the output, providing high speed and high current drive without the need for output buffers. Thermometer-coded implementations require 2^N - 1 unit current sources and a thermometer encoder, ensuring monotonicity but with large area and complexity. Binary-weighted implementations use only N current sources scaled by powers of two but require very accurate large current sources for MSBs. Mismatches in current sources cause INL and DNL errors; worst-case INL scales with 2^(N-1) times maximum mismatch, forcing extremely tight matching (on the order of sub-nA for µA currents at 12-bit resolution). DNL errors require less stringent matching but must still be under 1/4 LSB for linearity guarantees.  
   **External example:** Current steering DACs are commonly used in high-speed communication systems and require careful current source design to minimize nonlinearities (IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems, "Current Steering DAC Principles," https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/884239).

3. **Q:** Explain the principles of operation of charge-scaling DACs, the effect of capacitor matching and layout techniques on their accuracy, and how the split capacitor array reduces capacitor size for high-resolution implementations.  
   **A:** Charge-scaling DACs use binary-weighted capacitors switched between VREF and ground; the output voltage is determined by charge redistribution on the capacitor array connected to an op-amp. Accuracy depends on precise matching of capacitors; mismatch causes INL and DNL errors similar to current-steering DACs with the unit capacitance taking the role of unit current. Layout is critical: unit capacitors arranged in common-centroid patterns reduce errors from oxide gradients and process variations, while using unit capacitors avoids ratio errors from fabrication undercutting. The split array reduces the large MSB capacitor size by dividing the capacitor array into MSB and LSB groups separated by an attenuation capacitor, significantly saving chip area while preserving linearity.  
   **External example:** Capacitor mismatch limits the accuracy of SAR ADCs and charge-redistribution DACs, addressed by unit capacitor arrays and common-centroid layouts (Texas Instruments Application Report, "Capacitor Matching and Layout Techniques," https://www.ti.com/lit/an/slyt570/slyt570.pdf).

4. **Q:** Compare the cyclic and pipeline DAC architectures in terms of conversion time, complexity, and accuracy challenges, highlighting the role and limitations of the amplifier gain in pipeline DACs.  
   **A:** Cyclic DACs convert one bit per clock cycle recycling the residue via a feedback amplifier with gain 0.5, requiring N clock cycles for an N-bit conversion (serial operation), but use minimal hardware. Pipeline DACs extend the cyclic concept into N parallel stages, each converting one bit simultaneously, allowing one conversion per clock cycle after initial latency of N clocks, but with much higher hardware complexity. Both require precise amplifiers; pipeline DAC amplifiers must have very high open-loop gain increasing exponentially with bits (doubling gain requirement per bit). Restrictions on amplifier gain, linearity, and offset limit maximum achievable resolution (~12 bits), and gain accuracy errors impact overall INL and DNL.  
   **External example:** Pipeline DACs are widely used in video and communication systems for their speed and resolution trade-offs; amplifier gain errors critically affect their performance (IEEE Circuits and Devices magazine, "Pipeline and Nyquist DAC architectures," https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1477737).

5. **Q:** What are the main sources of nonlinearity in Flash ADC architectures, and how do resistor-string mismatches and comparator offset voltages combine to affect the ADC’s INL and DNL? Why is Flash ADC resolution typically limited to 8 bits in CMOS?  
   **A:** Flash ADCs use a resistor-string DAC to generate reference voltages to feeding multiple comparators. Resistor mismatches cause voltage errors on taps, leading to INL and DNL proportional to mismatch magnitude and resistor count. Comparator input offset voltage adds directly to INL and DNL, making high resolution challenging. The maximum INL includes contributions from resistor mismatch and maximum comparator offset. Since comparator offset is often larger than allowable INL at resolutions beyond 8 bits, and resistor string length grows exponentially, practical CMOS implementations rarely exceed 8 bits. DNL is less affected but still limited by the same factors.  
   **External example:** Modern Flash ADC resolution is constrained by comparator offset and resistor ladder mismatch to 6-8 bits in CMOS (Analog Devices Inc., Flash ADC Technology Overview, https://www.analog.com/en/analog-dialogue/articles/flash-adc-technology.html).

6. **Q:** Describe the working principle of a successive-approximation ADC (SAR ADC), including how it uses a DAC internally, and discuss the critical role of DAC accuracy and matching in determining its overall resolution and error.  
   **A:** The SAR ADC performs a binary search by successively setting bits in a register and comparing the DAC output to the input voltage. It starts with the MSB set to 1, converts via DAC, and uses comparator feedback to keep or reset the bit; it then proceeds to the next bit until all bits are tested. The DAC inside the SAR ADC converts the digital guess back to analog for comparison; its accuracy and matching directly impact the correctness of subsequent comparisons. Errors or mismatch in the DAC cause wrong bit settings early in the search, leading to large resolution loss. In charge-redistribution SAR ADCs, capacitor matching (equivalent of DAC accuracy) is paramount to prevent INL and DNL errors beyond half an LSB.  
   **External example:** SAR ADCs in microcontrollers rely on well-matched capacitive DACs to achieve 12-16 bits resolution (Texas Instruments, "How Successive Approximation ADCs Work," https://www.ti.com/lit/an/slla427/slla427.pdf).

7. **Q:** How does the oversampling ADC architecture improve resolution over Nyquist rate converters, what is the role of the sigma-delta (ΣΔ) modulator, and how does noise shaping influence the signal-to-noise ratio within the signal bandwidth?  
   **A:** Oversampling ADCs sample the input at much higher rates than Nyquist, simplifying anti-alias filtering and allowing use of simple analog components. The ΣΔ modulator converts the input to a high-rate bitstream representing average input via a feedback loop with an integrator, comparator, and 1-bit DAC. Noise shaping pushes quantization noise to high frequencies outside the signal bandwidth, achieving much lower in-band noise power. Digital filtering then removes out-of-band noise and decimates the sample rate, yielding high-resolution output. Increasing modulator order and oversampling ratio enhances noise shaping and improves resolution and dynamic range.  
   **External example:** Sigma-delta ADCs are widely used in audio and instrumentation due to their excellent resolution and noise-shaping capabilities (Texas Instruments, "Introduction to Sigma-Delta ADCs," https://www.ti.com/lit/an/slva617/slva617.pdf).

8. **Q:** In a pipeline ADC, how do comparator offset and sample-and-hold offset voltages propagate through the stages, and why do the first stages require higher precision than the later stages?  
   **A:** Comparator and sample-and-hold (S/H) offsets in the first stage directly add to the integral nonlinearity (INL) and differential nonlinearity (DNL), impacting overall accuracy significantly since subsequent stage gains amplify early errors. In later stages, the effect of these offsets is divided by the gain product of preceding residue amplification stages, reducing their impact on overall performance. Therefore, early pipeline stages require very low offsets and high accuracy to achieve overall high resolution, while latter stages can tolerate larger offsets and be optimized for lower power and area.  
   **External example:** Modern pipeline ADC designs include calibration of early stages' offsets but relax specifications for later stages to optimize efficiency (Analog Devices, "Understanding Pipeline ADCs," https://www.analog.com/en/education/education-library/tutorial-understanding-pipeline-adcs.html).

9. **Q:** Compare the single-slope and dual-slope ADC architectures in terms of conversion time, complexity, and accuracy, and explain why dual-slope ADCs are often preferred for high resolution despite longer conversion times.  
   **A:** Single-slope ADCs integrate the input signal and count the clock cycles until the integrator output crosses the sample voltage; their conversion time is proportional to input amplitude, requiring a high-frequency clock for full-scale input and fast sampling of signals. Dual-slope ADCs first integrate the unknown input for a fixed period, then integrate a known reference voltage back to zero, measuring the time to return. Dual-slope ADCs cancel out variations in the integrator components, clock frequency, and offset voltages, enhancing accuracy. Despite longer conversion times, dual-slope ADCs are preferred for applications requiring high precision (e.g., digital multimeters) due to their noise immunity and component tolerance.  
   **External example:** Dual-slope ADCs are used in precision measurement instruments for their noise rejection and accuracy, at the expense of conversion speed (Keysight Technologies, "Dual-Slope Analog-to-Digital Converter Differences," https://www.keysight.com/us/en/assets/7018-06393/brochures/5990-7957.pdf).

The chapter discusses the design, operation, and characteristics of digital phase-locked loops (DPLLs) and delay-locked loops (DLLs) used for clock recovery and synchronization in communication systems, focusing on components such as phase detectors (XOR and phase frequency detectors), voltage-controlled oscillators (VCOs), loop filters, and voltage-controlled delay lines (VCDLs). It highlights design criteria, trade-offs in loop filter parameters, methods to reduce jitter, and practical implementations and simulations of DPLL and DLL circuits for high-frequency applications.

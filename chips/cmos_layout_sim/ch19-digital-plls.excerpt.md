The chapter discusses the design and operation of digital phase-locked loops (DPLLs), emphasizing the roles of phase detectors (XOR and phase frequency detector), voltage-controlled oscillators (VCOs), and loop filters in achieving synchronization of clock signals with incoming digital data. It also covers practical considerations such as noise rejection, jitter minimization, data encoding formats, and introduces delay-locked loops (DLLs) as an alternative to reduce oscillator noise and jitter, highlighting their architectures, design equations, and implementation challenges in modern CMOS integrated circuits.

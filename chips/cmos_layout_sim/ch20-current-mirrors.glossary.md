- **Beta-multiplier** — A current reference circuit that uses two MOSFETs and a resistor to generate a bias current independent of power supply variations; named for the ratio of transistor sizes (β).
- **Channel-length modulation (λ)** — Variation in MOSFET drain current due to changes in drain-to-source voltage, modeled as a finite output resistance.
- **Compliance range** — The range of output voltages over which a current source maintains a nearly constant current.
- **Current mirror** — A circuit that copies (mirrors) a reference current from one branch to another, ideally producing a constant output current.
- **Diode-connected MOSFET** — A transistor with gate and drain connected together, forcing it to operate as a voltage drop element.
- **Differential amplifier (diff-amp)** — A circuit that amplifies the difference between two input voltages; used to regulate voltages in current mirrors.
- **Drain-to-source voltage (VDS)** — The voltage difference between the drain and source terminals of a MOSFET.
- **Drain-source saturation voltage (VDS,sat)** — The minimum VDS required to keep a MOSFET operating in saturation.
- **Finite output resistance (r0)** — The non-ideal resistance seen at the output of a current source or transistor, limiting current source behavior.
- **Floating current source** — A current source where the voltage across the device is set by bias voltages, allowing connection without a fixed reference potential.
- **Gate-source voltage (VGS)** — The voltage difference between the gate and source terminals of a MOSFET.
- **MOSFET output resistance (ro)** — The small-signal resistance seen looking into the drain of a MOSFET in saturation, related to channel-length modulation.
- **Output compliance** — The voltage range within which a current source behaves as intended, maintaining constant current output.
- **Output resistance (Ro)** — The incremental resistance looking into the output terminal of a current mirror or current source.
- **Parasitic capacitance (Cdb, Csb)** — Capacitances associated with the drain or source junctions to the substrate, proportional to device width.
- **Positive feedback** — A feedback where the output reinforces the input, which can lead to instability if the loop gain is too high.
- **Reference current (IREF)** — The current established in the reference side of a current mirror which is copied to other branches.
- **Self-biased circuit** — A circuit that generates its own bias current or voltage without external reference.
- **Setup voltage (Vbias)** — The bias voltage at gates or drains established by bias circuits to set operating points.
- **Short-channel effects** — Non-ideal behaviors in scaled-down MOSFETs, including reduced output resistance and increased sensitivity to VDS.
- **Start-up circuit** — Additional circuitry used in self-biased circuits to prevent the operating point from settling at zero current.
- **Subthreshold region** — MOSFET operation region where VGS is below threshold and current conduction is due to weak inversion.
- **Threshold voltage mismatch (ΔVTH)** — Variability in threshold voltage between nominally identical MOSFETs, causing current mismatch.
- **Transconductance parameter (KP)** — The process-dependent parameter related to mobility and oxide capacitance affecting MOSFET current.
- **Trim or Dummy poly strips** — Extra poly gates added alongside devices in layout to minimize undercut effects and improve matching.
- **Wide-swing cascode** — A cascode current mirror design optimized to minimize voltage headroom allowing operation at lower supply voltages.

- **Access MOSFET** — The transistor in a memory cell that connects the storage element to the bit line when the word (row) line is activated.
- **Array Efficiency** — The ratio of the area used for memory cells to the total chip area in a memory circuit.
- **Bit Line (Digit Line/Column Line)** — The conductive line along columns in a memory array that connects multiple memory cells; acts as a capacitive node loaded by each connected cell.
- **Capacitive Coupling** — Unwanted capacitive interaction between adjacent metal or poly lines, contributing to noise and signal degradation.
- **Column Decoder** — Circuit used to select the appropriate bit line(s) corresponding to the column address in a memory.
- **Contention Current** — Undesired current flowing directly from VDD to ground when two or more transistors conduct simultaneously during sense amplifier switching.
- **Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM)** — Memory where data is stored as charge on a capacitor and requires periodic refreshing due to leakage.
- **Equilibration** — The process of equalizing bit lines to the same voltage (typically VDD/2) prior to sensing, to provide a known initial condition.
- **Erase (Memory Cell)** — Operation to remove stored charge from a floating gate to reset the memory bit to a known state, such as via UV light or electrical tunneling.
- **Fowler-Nordheim Tunneling (FNT)** — Quantum mechanical tunneling of electrons through a thin oxide layer, used for programming and erasing Flash memory.
- **Floating Gate** — Isolated polysilicon layer in nonvolatile memory devices that stores charge trapped to represent data.
- **Folded Array Architecture** — Memory array layout where bit lines from two arrays are physically interleaved to improve noise immunity.
- **Gate-Drain Overlap Capacitance** — Parasitic capacitance at the overlap region between the gate and drain of a MOSFET, contributing to bit line loading.
- **Kickback Noise** — Voltage disturbance fed back into the input node of a sense amplifier during its switching event.
- **Line Pitch** — The physical distance between corresponding points of repeating elements in a memory array (e.g., between bit lines).
- **Local Decoder** — Decoder implemented close to the memory array, decoding address bits locally to select rows or columns.
- **Metastability** — A condition in sense amplifiers where the circuit fails to resolve to a stable logic level due to insufficient input signal difference.
- **Memory Cell** — The fundamental storage element in a memory array that holds a bit of data.
- **NMOS Sense Amplifier (NSA)** — Sense amplifier using NMOS devices for detecting small voltage differences on bit lines.
- **Open Array Architecture** — Memory array with memory cells at every row-column intersection arranged like an open book, with sense amplifiers connected between two arrays.
- **Pass Transistor** — Transistor used in column or row decoder outputs to pass signals; typically NMOS that pass a strong '0' but a degraded '1'.
- **PMOS Sense Amplifier (PSA)** — Sense amplifier using PMOS devices to pull bit lines to full logic '1' levels after sensing.
- **Precharge-Evaluate (PE) Logic** — Dynamic logic style where outputs are precharged and then conditionally discharged during evaluation phase.
- **Row Decoder** — Circuit that selects a particular memory word line from the row address inputs.
- **Row Driver** — Circuit used to drive word (row) lines to a voltage higher than VDD (e.g., pumped voltage) to fully turn on access transistors.
- **Sense Amplifier** — Circuit that detects and amplifies the small voltage changes on bit lines during read operations.
- **Static Random Access Memory (SRAM)** — Memory using six-transistor cross-coupled inverters that holds data as long as power is applied without refreshing.
- **Voltage Threshold (VTH)** — The gate-to-source voltage at which a MOSFET begins to conduct significantly.
- **Word Line** — A conductor line that enables access transistors in a row of memory cells when activated.

1. **Q:** Explain the construction and operation principle of a CMOS transmission gate (TG), including how it passes both logic high and low signals, and describe how its propagation delay is estimated when driving a large load capacitance.  
   **A:** A CMOS TG consists of an NMOS and PMOS transistor connected in parallel. The NMOS transistor passes logic lows well, while the PMOS transistor passes logic highs well. When the select signal S is high, both transistors conduct, making the TG pass both high and low logic levels efficiently. The equivalent resistance between input and output is the parallel combination of the NMOS and PMOS resistances (Rn||Rp). The propagation delay through the TG driving a large load capacitance Cload is estimated by \( t_{pHL} = t_{pLH} = 0.7 \times (R_n \| R_p) \times C_{load} \), reflecting symmetrical rise and fall times.  
   **External example:** The CMOS transmission gate's complementary structure to pass both logic levels efficiently is explained by Texas Instruments in their Analog Engineer’s Circuit Cookbook: https://www.ti.com/lit/an/slva549/slva549.pdf

2. **Q:** Describe how the series connection of CMOS transmission gates affects delay, and explain the components of the delay formula for N TGs driving a load capacitance.  
   **A:** In series connection of N CMOS TGs, each internal node’s capacitance is the sum of the oxide capacitances from adjacent MOS devices (Coxn + Coxp). The delay through the chain includes two components: the linear delay proportional to the number of TGs and load capacitance, and the quadratic RC transmission line effect from internal parasitic capacitances. The total delay is estimated by \( t_{pHL} = t_{pLH} = 0.7 \times N \times (R_n \| R_p) \times C_{load} + 0.35 \times (R_n \| R_p) \times (C_{oxn} + C_{oxp}) \times N^2 \). The first term models charging the load through cumulative resistances; the second models delay due to the RC ladder formed by series TGs’ parasitics.  
   **External example:** The RC delay model for cascaded pass transistor logic is analyzed in "CMOS Digital Integrated Circuits" by Rabaey et al., Addison-Wesley, 2003: https://ptolemy.berkeley.edu/projects/chipmunk/publications/books/CMOS_Digital_ICs.pdf

3. **Q:** How is the flip-flop (FF) based on cross-coupled inverters designed to mitigate metastability, and what causes metastability in such circuits?  
   **A:** Metastability in cross-coupled inverter FFs occurs when input and output voltages are near the switching threshold (Vsp), an unstable or quasi-stable state not representing valid logic levels. To mitigate this, designers increase inverter gain by lengthening transistor channels or cascading inverters (e.g., having three inverters along the loop) to sharpen voltage transfer characteristics and promote rapid state transitions. Additionally, ensuring strong driving signals and incorporating switches to isolate feedback during transitions reduce metastability risks.  
   **External example:** An explanation of metastability and its mitigation strategies in flip-flops is provided by the IEEE Solid-State Circuits Society: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6295519

4. **Q:** What are the setup time and hold time in a D flip-flop, and how do they relate to the internal delays of the flip-flop’s input stage?  
   **A:** Setup time (ts) is the minimum duration the input data (D) must be stable before the clock's active edge to ensure correct capture. Hold time (th) is the minimum time the data must remain stable after the clock edge. Internally, ts arises from the propagation delay through the TG and first inverter driving the latch input node—D data must be settled before clock arrival. Hold time depends on the data path and latch feedback delays; interestingly, hold times can be positive or negative depending on circuit delays, and in the flip-flop discussed, metastability and timing are heavily influenced by these delays.  
   **External example:** Setup and hold times are thoroughly defined in the JEDEC Standard No. JESD21-C: https://www.jedec.org/sites/default/files/docs/JESD21-C.pdf

5. **Q:** What are the key advantages and potential drawbacks of using transmission gates in the implementation of multiplexers (MUX) and static logic gates?  
   **A:** Transmission gates efficiently pass both logic levels, reducing voltage drop issues inherent in pass transistor logic, making them ideal for multiplexers, such as 4-to-1 MUX structures, where the control signals enable one data path. TG-based implementations allow bi-directional operation and simplified layout by grouping PMOS and NMOS devices. However, drawbacks include increased input capacitance on the select signals (affecting speed), and careful clock/control signal design is necessary to manage input loading and ensure fast switching, as overly large TGs increase delay on control lines despite reducing data path delay.  
   **External example:** The benefits and design considerations for TG-based MUX circuits are detailed by University of Toronto EE CS lecture notes: https://www.eecg.utoronto.ca/~jayar/pdfs/lect_tg.pdf

6. **Q:** Discuss the operation of an arbiter circuit constructed from NAND gates with inverters, including its role, how it avoids simultaneous outputs going high, and its relevance in asynchronous design.  
   **A:** The arbiter inputs two requests and outputs two signals where only one can be high at a time, resolving conflicts on which request arrived first. The NAND gates and inverters are arranged so that when one input goes high first, power to the other output’s PMOS inverter transistor is cut off, preventing that output from going high simultaneously. This mechanism ensures mutual exclusion and prevents metastable or race conditions common when inputs arrive almost simultaneously, making it essential in asynchronous systems or clock domain crossing synchronization. Adding inverters increases gate gain, speeding resolution to stable states.  
   **External example:** A modern arbiter design and its role in asynchronous circuits is discussed by the IEEE Transactions on Computers: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/893706

7. **Q:** Explain how increasing MOSFET width in transmission gates affects propagation delays and control signal delay, detailing the trade-offs designers must consider based on the text.  
   **A:** Increasing the width of MOSFETs in a TG reduces the on resistance (Rn and Rp) lowering the propagation delay when driving a given load capacitance, thus speeding signal transmission. However, this also increases the input capacitance on the select control lines (S and \(\overline{S}\)), causing longer delays in turning the TG on or off, as these signals require charging larger capacitive loads. Designers must balance the lower signal delay against the slower control signal transitions and possibly use buffered control signals to better represent on-chip drive conditions in simulations.  
   **External example:** The width-to-delay trade-off in CMOS pass gates is analyzed in the MIT OpenCourseWare on VLSI design: https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-374-analysis-and-design-of-digital-integrated-circuits-fall-2003/lecture-notes/lecture08.pdf

1. **Q:** Explain how matching of MOSFET devices in a current mirror is affected by threshold voltage mismatch, transconductance parameter mismatch, and drain-to-source voltage differences. How can layout techniques help minimize these mismatches?
   **A:** Threshold voltage mismatch causes output current errors inversely proportional to the gate overdrive voltage (VGS - VTH); higher gate overdrive reduces mismatch effects. Transconductance parameter mismatch similarly causes current errors proportional to parameter variations. Drain-to-source voltage differences lead to errors due to channel-length modulation (lambda); output current varies with differing VDS across mirror transistors. Layout techniques such as using longer channel lengths, parallel device splitting, common-centroid arrangements, symmetrical orientation, dummy poly strips, and multiple contacts reduce process gradients and implantation variations, thereby minimizing mismatches.
   **External example:** Precision current mirrors require device matching, and layout techniques like common-centroid are standard to reduce mismatch as detailed by Pelgrom et al. [IEEE JSSC, 1989](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/106351)

2. **Q:** Describe the operation and advantages of the Beta-multiplier reference circuit for biasing current mirrors in long-channel CMOS processes, including its startup mechanism and stability considerations.
   **A:** The Beta-multiplier uses two MOSFETs sized with a ratio (K), and a resistor in the source leg to produce a bias current independent of power supply voltage (VDD), relying on positive feedback to stabilize current and voltage. The resistor and device sizing set a stable gate overdrive voltage (Vov). A startup circuit is included to prevent the zero-current undesired operating point by injecting current to push the circuit into the correct positive feedback loop. Stability is ensured by choosing appropriate resistor values and minimizing parasitic capacitances; too small a resistor or large parasitic capacitance can cause oscillations.
   **External example:** Beta-multiplier references and their startup circuits are standard in analog IC design for stable biasing, as explained in Razavi’s "Design of Analog CMOS Integrated Circuits" (section 5.1.1) [Razavi Book](https://www.pearson.com/us/higher-education/program/Razavi-Design-of-Analog-CMOS-Integrated-Circuits-2nd-Edition/PGM333562.html)

3. **Q:** How does channel-length modulation (lambda) impact the accuracy of a basic current mirror, and what circuit techniques increase the output resistance to mitigate this effect?
   **A:** Channel-length modulation causes the drain current of MOSFETs to vary with drain-to-source voltage (VDS), deviating from ideal constant current mirror behavior, leading to output current errors when VDS differs between devices. To mitigate this, cascode current mirrors add a second transistor stacked to keep VDS of the main mirror transistor constant, increasing output resistance by roughly a factor of (2 + gm·ro + gm·ro·A), where A is amplifier gain if used. Wide-swing cascode designs lower the required output voltage while maintaining high output resistance. Adding feedback amplifiers further increases output resistance by controlling the drain voltage of the mirror transistor.
   **External example:** Cascode current mirrors to improve output resistance are a standard technique, as shown in Razavi’s textbook and in [Texas Instruments Application Note](https://www.ti.com/lit/an/sloa049/sloa049.pdf)

4. **Q:** Compare and contrast the behavior and design considerations of current mirrors implemented in long-channel versus short-channel CMOS technologies.
   **A:** Long-channel devices have higher intrinsic output resistance (high ro), allowing relatively simple cascode or Beta-multiplier biasing circuits with low supply sensitivity and good matching. Short-channel devices exhibit much lower ro and stronger dependence of current on VDS due to enhanced channel-length modulation and velocity saturation, causing current mirror inaccuracy and high supply sensitivity. To combat this, short-channel designs employ regulated cascode mirrors with feedback amplifiers to force equal VDS, longer channel devices to increase ro, and larger biasing devices or resistor adjustments. Stability and compensation capacitors are critical to ensure the feedback loop remains stable in short-channel implementations.
   **External example:** Scaling effects in short-channel CMOS require advanced biasing and cascode circuits, extensively discussed in [Pei et al., IEEE JSSC 1998](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/658110)

5. **Q:** Explain how current mirror bias circuits behave over temperature, including the temperature coefficients of resistor-MOSFET and MOSFET-only references, and how these behaviors can be modeled and compensated.
   **A:** In resistor-MOSFET references, current temperature coefficient (TC) combines resistor TC (often positive) and MOSFET threshold voltage TC (typically negative). The resulting reference current TC is approximately TCR - (dVTH/dT)/(VDD - VG) and can be positive or negative depending on these values. MOSFET-only references have mostly negative TC due to mobility degradation (approximately -1.5/T) and threshold variations. Beta-multiplier references combine resistor TC and mobility TC, potentially stabilizing TC by choosing resistor materials. Temperature dependence is modeled by linearizing around room temperature via TC parameters. Compensation involves resistor choice with appropriate TC or circuit topologies balancing opposing effects.
   **External example:** Temperature-compensated current references using MOSFET and resistor TC balancing are standard, as summarized in [Gray & Meyer, “MOS Analog Circuits,” Wiley, 1984] and described in [Analog Devices Application Note AN-86](https://www.analog.com/media/en/technical-documentation/application-notes/AN-86.pdf)

6. **Q:** What are the practical layout strategies to reduce parasitic resistance and capacitance in wide devices used in current mirrors, and how do dummy poly strips and device interdigitation improve matching?
   **A:** Large devices are split into multiple parallel fingers each with smaller width, reducing average parasitic resistance (implant resistance) due to multiple contacts and reducing substrate depletion capacitances (Cdb and Csb) roughly by (n+1)/2n for odd n fingers. Dummy poly strips flanking device arrays reduce edge undercut during fabrication, minimizing threshold voltage variation at device edges and improving matching. Interdigitating fingers of matched devices distribute process gradients evenly, reducing systematic mismatches caused by spatial gradients in process parameters, enhancing overall device matching and current mirror accuracy.
   **External example:** Layout practices for matching and parasitic control are standard in CMOS analog design, as detailed in Pelgrom et al., “Matching properties of MOS transistors,” IEEE JSSC, 1989 [https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/106351]

7. **Q:** Discuss the implications of supply voltage (VDD) variations on the reference currents of resistor-based and MOSFET-only biased current mirrors and how these variations are mitigated.
   **A:** Resistor-based current mirrors have reference currents linearly dependent on VDD due to fixed resistor voltage drops, causing poor supply rejection. MOSFET-only bias circuits reduce supply dependence by relying on transistor current-voltage characteristics but still have finite sensitivity due to mobility and threshold voltage variations. The Beta-multiplier further mitigates supply variation by incorporating positive feedback, reducing current dependence on VDD. Adding feedback amplifiers to regulate transistor voltages also enhances supply independence. However, stability and startup circuits are necessary to avoid undesired zero-current states.
   **External example:** Positive-feedback based biasing and startup circuits for supply-independent current references are standard in analog ICs, as discussed by Razavi (Design of Analog CMOS Integrated Circuits) [https://www.pearson.com]

8. **Q:** How can the output resistance of a current mirror be increased using feedback, and what are the trade-offs involved with stability and minimum voltage compliance?
   **A:** Output resistance is enhanced by adding a differential amplifier that senses drain voltages of mirror transistors and adjusts gate bias to keep them equal, effectively regulating drain potentials. This feedback increases output resistance by approximately the amplifier gain factor. Trade-offs include circuit complexity, increased power consumption, need for compensation capacitors to ensure stability, added minimum voltage headroom due to stacked devices and bias nodes, and risk of oscillations if compensation is inadequate or if passive parasitic capacitances interact adversely.
   **External example:** Using gain-boosting amplifiers to increase output resistance is a technique standard in analog design, e.g., Säckinger and Guggenbühl, “A High-Swing, High-Impedance MOS Cascode Circuit,” IEEE JSSC 1990 [https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/51884]

9. **Q:** Describe the design and operation of a floating current source based on the cascode topology and its usefulness in integrated analog circuits.
   **A:** A floating current source is formed by adding MOSFETs (MFCP, MFCN) to cascode devices, allowing the voltage across the cascode to be set by bias voltages (e.g., Vbiasl, Vbias4) instead of directly by supply rails. This provides a stable, known voltage node where current can be sourced or sunk, independent of absolute supply variations, facilitating biasing of subsequent stages. It enables placing a transistor connected to these nodes (e.g., MON) with predictable biasing for precise current scaling. This topology is especially useful in multistage amplifiers to ensure bias currents and voltages are well controlled.
   **External example:** Floating current sources are common for stable biasing in analog ICs, described in “CMOS Analog Circuit Design” by Baker et al. (2008) [https://www.wiley.com/en-us/CMOS+Analog+Circuit+Design-p-9780471676745]

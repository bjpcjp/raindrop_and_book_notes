- **AC Component** — The alternating current or varying part of a voltage or current signal.
- **Carrier Lifetime (τT)** — Average time an electron or hole exists before recombining in a semiconductor.
- **CMOS** — Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor, a technology for constructing integrated circuits.
- **Depletion Region** — Area around a pn junction where mobile charge carriers are depleted, creating a charge region.
- **Depletion Capacitance** — Parasitic capacitance formed in the depletion region of a pn junction diode.
- **Design Rules** — Constraints on dimensions and spacing in integrated circuit layout to ensure proper fabrication and function.
- **Diode** — Semiconductor device formed by a pn junction allowing current to flow primarily in one direction.
- **Diffusion Capacitance** — Capacitance due to stored minority carriers in a forward-biased diode.
- **Distributed RC Circuit** — A resistance-capacitance network spread along a material, resembling a transmission line.
- **DRC Program (Design Rule Checker)** — Software tool used to verify that layouts comply with design rules.
- **Epitaxial Layer (Epi Layer)** — A layer of silicon grown on the wafer with controlled doping, often used in CMOS fabrication.
- **Emission Coefficient (n)** — Parameter related to diode doping profiles affecting diode current characteristics.
- **Fermi Level (EF)** — Energy level with 50% probability of occupancy by an electron, used to describe carrier distributions.
- **Intrinsic Carrier Concentration (ni)** — Number of electrons or holes in pure (undoped) silicon at thermal equilibrium.
- **Layout** — The geometric design of layers defining devices and interconnections on an integrated circuit.
- **Lateral Diffusion** — Sideways extension of dopants under masking layers during diffusion processes.
- **Mask** — Photolithography stencil used to pattern layers on a semiconductor wafer.
- **Mass-Action Law** — Principle stating the product of electron and hole concentrations equals intrinsic carrier concentration squared.
- **n-well Process** — CMOS fabrication process where p-channel devices are formed in an n-type well inside a p-type substrate.
- **Parasitic Diode** — Unintended diode formed by pn junctions such as between n-well and p-substrate.
- **P-n Junction** — Interface between p-type and n-type semiconductor materials forming a diode.
- **Photolithography** — Process using light and photosensitive resist to pattern features on a semiconductor wafer.
- **Sheet Resistance (Rsquare)** — Resistance of a thin film expressed in ohms per square, independent of size.
- **Shot Noise** — Fluctuations in current caused by discrete charge carriers (not detailed but implied in diode operation).
- **SiO2 (Silicon Dioxide)** — Insulating layer grown or deposited on silicon wafers to electrically isolate regions.
- **Thermal Voltage (VT)** — Voltage term proportional to temperature, appearing in diode current equations (~26mV at room temp).
- **Twin-Well Process** — CMOS process employing both n-type and p-type wells to reduce doping issues and improve device quality.
- **Well** — A doped semiconductor region (n-well or p-well) used as body for MOS transistors within a substrate.

This chapter presents delta-sigma modulation (DSM) as an effective sensing technique that converts analog signals, such as currents or voltages, into digital outputs by averaging over time, thereby improving precision and noise tolerance in applications like Flash memory, resistive memory, and CMOS imaging. The technique relies on a feedback loop controlling charge flow into a capacitive "bucket," allowing robust measurement of small or noisy signals with adjustable resolution and inherent noise averaging, while addressing practical design considerations such as comparator offset, feedback linearity, and mismatch effects.

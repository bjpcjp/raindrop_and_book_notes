This chapter explains delta-sigma modulation (DSM) as a powerful sensing technique for converting analog signals, such as currents or voltages in memory cells, resistive devices, and CMOS imagers, into precise digital representations by averaging discrete comparator outputs over time. The text details DSM circuit designs, including switched-capacitor implementations, feedback mechanisms to ensure constant charge transfer, and methods to reduce errors and mismatches, demonstrating applications in Flash memory sensing, resistive memory, and CMOS imaging with improved noise performance and resolution.

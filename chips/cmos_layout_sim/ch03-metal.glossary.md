- **Bonding Pad** — The interface area on the die where a wire is soldered to connect the chip to the package or external circuitry, typically made with metal2 and sized according to design rules.  
- **Capacitance** — The ability of a system to store charge; parasitic capacitances occur between metal layers and substrate or between metal layers themselves.  
- **Crosstalk** — Unwanted electrical interference between neighboring conductors caused by mutual capacitance and inductance, resulting in signal feedthrough.  
- **Decoupling Capacitor** — A capacitor placed between power (VDD) and ground to supply charge during transient current demands, reducing voltage fluctuations such as ground bounce and VDD droop.  
- **Design Rules** — Guidelines defining minimum widths, spacings, and sizes for metallization layers, vias, and other layout elements to ensure manufacturability and reliability.  
- **Dielectric Constant (Relative Dielectric Constant)** — A material property that affects capacitance; lower dielectric constants reduce parasitic capacitances between metal layers.  
- **Electromigration** — Physical degradation of a metal conductor caused by high current densities, leading to metal erosion and eventual circuit failure.  
- **Fringe Capacitance** — Parasitic capacitance occurring at the edges (perimeter) of metal structures.  
- **Interlayer Dielectric (ILD)** — The insulating material (often SiO₂ or low-k dielectric) separating different metal layers to prevent electrical shorts and reduce capacitance.  
- **Intrinsic Propagation Delay** — The theoretical signal delay in a transmission medium considering only its dielectric properties, neglecting resistance and parasitic effects.  
- **Metal1 (Metall)** — The bottom metal layer in a two-metal CMOS process, with specific sheet resistance and capacitances associated.  
- **Metal2** — The second metal layer above metal1 in a CMOS process, often the top metal layer used for bonding pads and routing.  
- **Mutual Capacitance (Cm)** — Capacitance between two adjacent conductors that causes charge coupling and noise (crosstalk).  
- **Mutual Inductance (Lm)** — Inductance shared between conductors that causes voltage induction and signal interference (crosstalk).  
- **Padframe** — An arrangement of bonding pads around the chip perimeter, spaced according to design rules, to facilitate packaging and external connections.  
- **Passivation** — The protective dielectric layer (insulator) over the chip surface that prevents contamination; openings (cuts) are made for bonding pads.  
- **Parasitic Capacitance** — Unwanted capacitance between circuit elements or metal layers that can degrade circuit performance.  
- **RC Delay** — The delay caused by the combined effect of resistance and capacitance in metal lines, dominating signal propagation speed in practical ICs.  
- **Scale Factor** — The ratio used to convert drawn layout dimensions to actual physical dimensions, e.g., 50 nm per drawing unit.  
- **Sheet Resistance** — The resistance of a thin film material (like metal or diffusion layers), expressed in ohms per square, used to calculate line resistance.  
- **Signal Delay** — Time taken for a voltage change to propagate through a conductor, influenced by both intrinsic material properties and parasitic effects.  
- **Via (Vial)** — A vertical interconnection (plug) that electrically connects two metal layers by filling an opening in the dielectric between them, with finite contact resistance.  
- **Voltage Drop** — The reduction in voltage along a conductor due to its resistance and current flow, important when sizing metal lines for power or signals.  
- **VDD Droop** — A temporary drop in the power supply voltage due to transient current loads and wiring resistance.  
- **Wire Width** — The physical width of a metal line, affecting resistance, current-carrying capacity, and capacitance.  
- **Wire Length** — The physical length of a metal conductor, affecting resistance and parasitic capacitances.  
- **Ground Bounce** — A transient increase in the local ground voltage causing undesired voltage fluctuations and potential circuit malfunction.

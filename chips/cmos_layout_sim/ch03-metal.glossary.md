- **Bonding Pad** — The metal area on a chip where an external wire is soldered to connect the die to the package or outside world.  
- **Capacitance (Fringe)** — The parasitic capacitance at the edges of a conductor, influencing signal coupling at conductor perimeters.  
- **Capacitance (Plate)** — The parasitic capacitance between two parallel conducting surfaces, like metal to substrate or metal-to-metal layers.  
- **CMOS Process** — A fabrication process for integrated circuits using complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor technology.  
- **Cross Talk** — Interference caused by capacitive or inductive coupling between adjacent conductors, leading to undesired signal feedthrough.  
- **Die (Wafer Die)** — The individual semiconductor chip cut from a wafer.  
- **Electromigration** — The gradual movement of metal atoms in a conductor caused by high current density, which can lead to failure.  
- **Fringe Capacitance** — Capacitance contributed by electric fields around the edges of a conductor or metal layer.  
- **Interlayer Dielectric (ILD)** — The insulating material between metal layers in an integrated circuit to prevent electrical shorts.  
- **Metal1 (Metall)** — The first (bottom) metal layer in a CMOS process, typically connecting devices and vias to upper metal layers.  
- **Metal2** — The second metal layer in a CMOS process, often the top routing layer or bonding pad layer.  
- **Padframe** — The arranged set of bonding pads around the perimeter of a chip.  
- **Passivation** — A protective insulating layer covering the chip surface to protect against contamination and mechanical damage.  
- **Scale Factor** — The factor used to convert layout drawing units into real physical dimensions during mask generation.  
- **Sheet Resistance** — The resistance of a thin film of material (like metal layers) expressed in ohms per square.  
- **Test Structures** — Specialized layout patterns used to characterize electrical properties like resistance and capacitance of materials.  
- **Thermal Oxide (FOX)** — A layer of silicon dioxide grown on silicon, often used as insulation or isolation in CMOS.  
- **Timing Delay (RC Delay)** — The time delay in signal propagation through a resistive and capacitive conductor modeled as an RC network.  
- **Vial (Via)** — A small opening or plug that provides electrical connection between two metal layers through the insulating ILD.  
- **Voltage Drop** — The reduction in voltage across a conductor caused by its resistance and current flow, impacting circuit operation.  
- **VDD Droop** — A temporary decrease in power supply voltage on a chip due to current surges and line resistance.  
- **Ground Bounce** — A temporary increase in ground potential at a circuit node caused by inductive and resistive effects in the ground path.

This chapter discusses nonlinear analog circuits, focusing on CMOS voltage comparator design, adaptive biasing techniques, and analog multiplier implementation. Key topics include comparator architecture with preamplification, decision, and output buffering stages, adaptive biasing for improved power efficiency and slew rate, and analog multipliers based on multiplying quads and squaring circuits, emphasizing their design principles, performance characteristics, and simulation approaches.

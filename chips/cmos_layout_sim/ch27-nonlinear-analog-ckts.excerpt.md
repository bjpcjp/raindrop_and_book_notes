This chapter covers nonlinear analog circuits, focusing on CMOS comparator design, adaptive biasing techniques, and analog multiplier design. It details the structure and operation of comparators including preamplification, decision and output buffer stages, explores clocked comparators and input buffers, and discusses adaptive biasing to improve power and performance, as well as analog multipliers implemented with multiplying quads and squaring circuits.

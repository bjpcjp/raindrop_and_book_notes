- **Capacitance (Cgd)** — The capacitance between the gate and drain of a MOSFET, important in switching and modeled as Cox/2.  
- **Charge (Q)** — The product of capacitance and voltage difference, representing stored electrical energy.  
- **Delay time (tdelay)** — The time interval between an input change and the corresponding output response in a digital circuit.  
- **Effective Switching Resistance (Rn, Rp)** — An approximate resistance representing the MOSFET channel during switching, used in digital models.  
- **Gate-Source Voltage (VGS)** — The voltage difference between the gate and source terminals of a MOSFET, controlling its conduction.  
- **Gate-Drain Capacitance (Cgd)** — The capacitance between the gate and drain terminals of a MOSFET, which affects switching speed.  
- **Long-Channel MOSFET** — A MOSFET device with channel length large enough to follow square-law characteristics and classical models.  
- **Miller Effect** — The effective multiplication of capacitance due to voltage gain between input and output nodes in a device.  
- **Minimum Channel Length (Scale factor)** — The smallest length used in device manufacturing processes, impacting device speed and capacitance.  
- **NMOS Pass Gate (PG)** — An NMOS transistor configured to pass logic levels, passing logic 0 well but degrading logic 1 by a threshold voltage drop.  
- **PMOS Pass Gate (PG)** — A PMOS transistor configured to pass logic levels, passing logic 1 well but degrading logic 0 by a threshold voltage drop.  
- **Process Characteristic Time Constant (τ)** — The intrinsic switching speed of a MOSFET defined by the product of its resistance and oxide capacitance.  
- **Propagation Delay (tPLH, tPHL)** — The time between input and output transitions, specifically high-to-low or low-to-high output changes.  
- **Short-Channel MOSFET** — A MOSFET with very small channel length where short-channel effects dominate and classical square-law models do not apply.  
- **Switching Resistance (Effective Resistance)** — The equivalent resistance a MOSFET exhibits during switching, influencing speed and delay.  
- **Switching Time (Transition Time)** — The time it takes for the output of a digital circuit to rise or fall between logic levels.  
- **Transmission Gate (TG)** — A parallel combination of NMOS and PMOS pass gates offering rail-to-rail transmission of logic signals with two control signals.  
- **Threshold Voltage (VTHN, VTHP)** — The minimum gate-to-source voltage required to turn an NMOS or PMOS transistor on.  
- **Triode Region** — The MOSFET operating region where it behaves like a resistor, relevant in switching models.  
- **Total Capacitance (Ctot)** — The sum of load capacitance and device intrinsic capacitances connected to a node, impacting delay.  
- **Transition Times (tLH, tHL)** — The output signal rise (low-to-high) and fall (high-to-low) times during switching.  
- **Voltage Swing** — The range between logic high and logic low output voltages; limited in single transistor pass gates.

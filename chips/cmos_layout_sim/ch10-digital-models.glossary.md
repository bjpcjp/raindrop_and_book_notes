- **Effective Switching Resistance** — The average resistance of a MOSFET when it is on, estimated by the reciprocal slope of the MOSFET’s I-V characteristics during switching.
- **Digital MOSFET Model** — A simplified MOSFET representation as a switch with an effective resistance and capacitances, used for hand calculations in digital circuit analysis.
- **Miller Capacitance** — The effective capacitance seen at the input or output when a capacitor connects nodes with opposite voltage transitions, effectively doubling the capacitance impact.
- **NMOS Pass Gate (PG)** — An NMOS transistor used as a switch that passes a logic '0' well but passes a logic '1' with a threshold voltage drop.
- **Oxide Capacitance (Cox)** — The capacitance between the gate and channel of a MOSFET, proportional to the gate oxide thickness and device geometry.
- **Pass Gate (PG)** — A MOSFET used as a switch to transfer signals, which can be NMOS or PMOS devices, exhibiting voltage threshold drops when passing certain logic levels.
- **PMOS Pass Gate (PG)** — A PMOS transistor used as a switch that passes a logic '1' well but passes a logic '0' with a threshold voltage drop.
- **Process Characteristic Time Constant (\(\tau\))** — The intrinsic switching speed of a MOSFET, approximately RnCox, which decreases with smaller channel length.
- **Propagation Delay (tPLH / tPHL)** — The delay time between input and output signal reaching 50% of voltage swing during low-to-high or high-to-low transitions.
- **Rise Time (trise)** — The time it takes for a signal to transition from low to high voltage levels, typically approximated as 2.2 times the RC time constant.
- **Short-Channel MOSFET** — A MOSFET with channel lengths on the order of tens of nanometers, which exhibits deviations from long-channel square-law models.
- **Square-Law MOSFET Model** — The traditional long-channel MOSFET model where current varies as the square of the gate overdrive voltage.
- **Switching Delay** — The time taken for a digital output to respond to an input change, often modeled as 0.7 times the effective MOSFET resistance times the load capacitance.
- **Switching Resistance (Rn, Rp)** — The effective on-resistance of NMOS and PMOS devices during switching, with PMOS resistance typically three times higher due to lower hole mobility.
- **Switching Time Constant (\(\tau\))** — Time constant for charging/discharging output nodes via MOSFET switches, key in determining circuit speed.
- **Transmission Gate (TG)** — A parallel combination of an NMOS and PMOS pass gate, controlled by complementary signals, providing rail-to-rail voltage transmission.
- **Transition Time (tLH / tHL)** — The duration of the output voltage transitioning from low to high (tLH) or high to low (tHL).
- **Tristate Output** — A high impedance state of a gate output, used to disconnect the output from a shared bus.
- **Voltage Threshold Drop** — The reduction in output voltage level when passing a logic '1' through an NMOS or a logic '0' through a PMOS pass gate, equal to the threshold voltage.
- **Wide Drawn Device Sizes (e.g., 10/1, 30/1)** — Standard device width-to-length ratios used in design to match effective resistances and drive strengths.

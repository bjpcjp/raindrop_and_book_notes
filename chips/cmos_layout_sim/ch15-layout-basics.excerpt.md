This chapter discusses VLSI layout design, emphasizing the importance of chip size, layout regularity, and efficient power and ground distribution to improve yield and performance. It compares standard-cell and full-custom design approaches, illustrating layout techniques through examples such as inverters, latches, adders, and multiplexers, and highlights steps from planning and stick diagrams to device placement and optimization.

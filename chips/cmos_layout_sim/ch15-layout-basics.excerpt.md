This chapter discusses the importance of chip size and layout organization in very-large-scale-integration (VLSI) design, emphasizing the benefits of smaller die sizes for increased yield and reduced cost per die. It also covers methods of chip layout including full-custom and standard-cell design, highlighting key considerations such as regularity, power and ground distribution, and techniques to optimize layout density and performance.

This chapter discusses differential amplifiers, focusing on their operation, design, and various configurations such as the source-coupled pair, source cross-coupled pair, and current differential amplifier, emphasizing their biasing, input voltage ranges, gain, noise performance, and common-mode rejection ratio. Detailed analyses and examples illustrate how device sizing, bias conditions, and load configurations affect the amplifier's performance, input range, output swing, and linearity, with practical considerations for low-power and wide-swing designs.

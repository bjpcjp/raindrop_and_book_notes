This chapter provides an in-depth analysis of differential amplifiers, focusing on three basic types: source-coupled pairs, source cross-coupled pairs, and current differential amplifiers, discussing their DC and AC operations, input ranges, noise performance, and common-mode rejection. It also examines various load configurations, biasing techniques, slew-rate limitations, and methods to improve input signal range and gain, emphasizing practical design considerations including device matching and offset voltage mitigation.

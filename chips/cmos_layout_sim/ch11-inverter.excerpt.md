The CMOS inverter is a fundamental digital circuit element characterized by output voltage swing from VDD to ground, near-zero static power dissipation, and adjustable logic switching threshold through device sizing. Key aspects discussed include its DC and switching characteristics, noise margins, propagation delays, layout considerations to prevent latch-up, strategies for driving large capacitive loads efficiently, and variations of inverter configurations including tri-state and NMOS-only designs.

The CMOS inverter, a fundamental digital circuit element, operates by switching the output between VDD and ground depending on the input voltage, with its performance characterized by transfer characteristics, noise margins, switching point voltage, and propagation delays. Design considerations such as sizing for large capacitive loads, layout to avoid latch-up, and buffer implementation for driving heavy loads are critical for optimizing inverter speed, power dissipation, and reliability.

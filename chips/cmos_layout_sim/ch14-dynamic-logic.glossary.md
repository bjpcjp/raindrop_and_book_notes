- **Charge leakage** — The unwanted discharge of stored charge from a dynamic node due to MOSFET off currents and parasitic leakage mechanisms.  
- **Clocked CMOS latch** — A latch using clock signals to control master and slave stages, where data storage relies on charge storage nodes.  
- **CMOS transmission gate (TG)** — A bidirectional switch composed of parallel NMOS and PMOS transistors used for charging or discharging nodes in dynamic logic.  
- **Dead time** — A delay interval between nonoverlapping clock phases during which both clock signals are low to prevent short circuits.  
- **Domino logic** — A dynamic logic style that adds an inverter after a precharge-evaluate gate to prevent glitches and enable cascading.  
- **Dynamic node (storage node)** — A high-impedance node in dynamic logic circuits that stores charge representing logic levels but is vulnerable to leakage and noise.  
- **Dynamic logic** — Logic design technique using clocked gating and charge storage on MOSFET input capacitances to reduce complexity and increase speed.  
- **Evaluate phase** — The clock phase in precharge-evaluate logic when the logic function is evaluated and the output condition is determined.  
- **Keeper MOSFET** — A weak PMOS transistor used in domino logic to maintain a dynamic node at a logic high level during hold times.  
- **Leakage current (off current)** — The small current that flows through a MOSFET when it is turned off, causing gradual discharge of stored charge.  
- **Level-sensitive latch** — A latch configuration sensitive to the level of the clock signal, typically holding charge on dynamic nodes during clock low phases.  
- **NMOS pass gate (PG)** — An NMOS transistor used as a switch in dynamic logic to pass logic levels during clock enable phases.  
- **NP logic (Zipper logic)** — A dynamic logic style that interleaves NMOS and PMOS logic stages to eliminate the inverter delay used in domino logic.  
- **Nonoverlapping clocks** — Clock signals designed such that two phases never overlap high simultaneously, preventing contention in dynamic logic circuits.  
- **Off current** — See leakage current; MOSFET current when switched off, contributing to charge loss on dynamic nodes.  
- **Phase delay** — The intentional delay inserted between clock phases to create nonoverlapping clock signals.  
- **Precharge phase** — The time during which a dynamic node is charged to a preset voltage (usually VDD) before the evaluation phase begins.  
- **Precharge-evaluate (PE) logic** — A dynamic logic design style that alternates between precharging the output node and evaluating the logic function each clock cycle.  
- **Propagation delay (tPHL and tPLH)** — Time intervals for output voltage transitions from high to low or low to high in logic gates.  
- **Storage capacitance (node capacitance, Cnode)** — The combined capacitance at a dynamic node including inverter input capacitance and parasitic capacitances.  
- **Switching point voltage (Vsp)** — The input voltage level where an inverter switches output states; irrelevant for PE logic due to output precharge.  
- **Transmission line effects** — Signal integrity considerations for signals passing through long or high-capacitance interconnects causing delay and distortion.  
- **Weak keeper device** — A keeper MOSFET sized to provide just enough current to maintain the charge on a storage node without preventing switching.

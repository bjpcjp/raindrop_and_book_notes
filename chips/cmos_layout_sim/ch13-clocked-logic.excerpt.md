This chapter discusses the design, operation, and timing analysis of CMOS transmission gates (TGs) and their applications in digital circuits such as multiplexers, static logic gates, latches, and flip-flops, emphasizing delay estimation and simulation techniques for optimizing performance. It also covers the challenges of metastability in cross-coupled inverters, the importance of clock signal quality, and the critical setup and hold times required for reliable flip-flop operation.

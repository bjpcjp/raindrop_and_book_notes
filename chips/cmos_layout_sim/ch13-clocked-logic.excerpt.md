This chapter discusses the design, operation, and applications of CMOS transmission gates (TGs) in digital circuits, including their use in multiplexers, static logic gates, latches, flip-flops, and arbiters, with detailed delay estimations, simulations, and timing considerations critical for performance optimization. Emphasis is placed on the structure and behavior of TG-based circuits, the impact of device sizing on delays and signal integrity, and the importance of clock signal characteristics in flip-flop functionality.

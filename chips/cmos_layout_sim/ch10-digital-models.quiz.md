1. **Q:** How does the MOSFET digital switch model define the ON and OFF states of NMOS and PMOS transistors, and what is the significance of the bubble drawn at the PMOS gate in circuit diagrams?  
   **A:** In the MOSFET digital switch model, an NMOS transistor is ON when its gate voltage is logic 1 (VDD) and OFF when its gate is logic 0 (ground). Conversely, a PMOS transistor operates complementarily, being ON when its gate is at logic 0 and OFF at logic 1. The bubble at the PMOS gate symbolically represents this inversion in logic control, highlighting its opposite operating condition to the NMOS device. This abstraction treats MOSFETs as simple logic-controlled switches for quick circuit analysis.

2. **Q:** Explain the "Miller effect" as it applies to the capacitance between the gate and drain of a MOSFET in digital switching, and describe how this affects the effective capacitance seen by input and output nodes.  
   **A:** The Miller effect in digital switching occurs because when the input node transitions from 0 to VDD while the output transitions from VDD to 0, the voltage across the gate-drain capacitor changes by 2×VDD. This results in each side (input or output) effectively seeing twice the capacitance (2C) of the physical capacitor C between input and output nodes. Consequently, the input or output voltage source must supply or sink charge equivalent to 2C×VDD, doubling the loading effect of the capacitance in switching analysis.  
   **External example:** A detailed explanation of the Miller effect and its influence on input capacitance can be found in Analog Devices’ application notes: https://www.analog.com/en/analog-dialogue/articles/miller-effect-in-amplifiers.html

3. **Q:** Describe how the effective switching resistance of a MOSFET is determined using the IV curve and define how it differs between long-channel and short-channel devices as per the digital modeling approach.  
   **A:** The effective switching resistance, Rn for NMOS, is estimated from the reciprocal slope of the drain current versus drain-source voltage (ID-VDS) curve during switching, particularly along the line from the saturation point to the linear region (points B to C in Fig. 10.5). For long-channel devices, Rn is approximated by VDD divided by the square of (VDD − VTHN), scaled by device parameters, and is mostly independent of device size scale factor. Short-channel devices do not follow the long-channel square-law; their effective resistance depends mainly on on-current (Ion), which is proportional to width and scale factor but independent of length for minimum channel lengths; increasing length beyond minimum increases resistance.  
   **External example:** The variability of MOSFET resistance with channel length and short-channel effects is discussed in the IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/22385

4. **Q:** What intrinsic process characteristic time constant governs the switching speed of MOSFETs in digital circuits, and how does it depend on technology parameters like channel length and supply voltage?  
   **A:** The intrinsic process characteristic time constant τn is given by the product of the effective MOSFET resistance Rn and the oxide capacitance Cox (τn = Rn ⋅ Cox). For long-channel devices, τn scales with the square of the channel length (L²) and inversely with (VDD − VTHN)², while being independent of channel width. Increased supply voltage VDD decreases τn, thus speeding up the device. For short-channel devices, τn decreases linearly with channel length due to different current behavior, again inversely dependent on VDD and device parameters.  
   **External example:** This time constant relationship forms the basis for CMOS switching speed analysis as covered by the IET Circuits, Devices & Systems journal: https://digital-library.theiet.org/content/journals/10.1049/cds_20050045

5. **Q:** How are propagation delay (tPLH and tPHL) and transition times (tLH and tHL) in digital MOSFET circuits estimated using the simplified digital model, and what assumptions limit the accuracy of these estimations?  
   **A:** Propagation delays for rising and falling outputs are approximated as tPLH = 0.7 ⋅ Rp ⋅ Cout and tPHL = 0.7 ⋅ Rn ⋅ Cout, where Rn and Rp are effective switching resistances for NMOS and PMOS respectively, and Cout is the total output capacitance. Transition times (rise and fall times) are roughly tLH = 2.2 ⋅ Rp ⋅ Cout and tHL = 2.2 ⋅ Rn ⋅ Cout. These estimates assume simplified linear RC behavior and zero input rise/fall time with switches opening or closing sharply at VDD/2 threshold. Real MOSFETs have nonlinearities, finite input transition times, and parasitic effects causing these models to be accurate only within a factor of about two.  
   **External example:** Standard delay estimation methods based on RC models are widely discussed in “CMOS Digital Integrated Circuits” by Kang and Leblebici: https://www.oxfordscience.com/view/10.1093/oso/9780195337147.001.0001/oso-9780195337147

6. **Q:** Explain why an NMOS pass gate passes a logic '0' well but degrades a logic '1', and conversely why a PMOS pass gate passes a logic '1' well but degrades a logic '0'. How does this limitation motivate the use of transmission gates?  
   **A:** An NMOS pass gate efficiently passes a strong logic '0' because it pulls the output node fully to ground when enabled. However, passing a logic '1' is degraded by one threshold voltage drop (VDD − VTHN), since the source and drain designation flips and the gate-to-source voltage drops below VTHN near VDD, turning the transistor off prematurely. Conversely, a PMOS pass gate passes a '1' well by bringing the output to VDD but passes a '0' only down to VTHP above ground for similar voltage threshold reasons. The combination of NMOS and PMOS in parallel as a transmission gate solves this, allowing full rail-to-rail swing with complementary control signals, at the cost of increased area and control complexity.  
   **External example:** This complementary pass gate concept is covered in the CMOS design handbook from Synopsys: https://www.synopsys.com/designware-ip/technical-bulletins/tech-brief-cmos-transmission-gates.html

7. **Q:** What is the impact of series-connected NMOS pass gates on delay, and how is the total delay through I series devices approximated? Include how the transmission line analogy aids this calculation.  
   **A:** The delay through a series connection of I identically sized NMOS pass gates is approximated by modeling the chain as an RC transmission line, yielding total delay tdelay ≈ 0.35 ⋅ Rn ⋅ Cox ⋅ I². The quadratic dependence on the number of devices (I²) arises from incremental resistance and node capacitance at each internal node, which cause the delay to grow more rapidly than a simple linear addition. The RC transmission line analogy applies because each MOSFET's resistance and gate capacitance form distributed RC sections along the chain.  
   **External example:** The RC transmission line delay model for deep submicron devices is well documented in “Digital Integrated Circuits” by Jan M. Rabaey et al.: https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9780130909961

8. **Q:** How do typical oscilloscope probing setups affect the capacitance loading on a CMOS digital circuit under test, and what design feature of compensated probes mitigates this issue?  
   **A:** Directly connecting an unmodified coaxial cable from a circuit node to an oscilloscope adds substantial parasitic capacitance (~100 pF/m of cable plus the scope input capacitance ~10 pF) and a 1 MΩ resistor to ground at the probe point, heavily loading and slowing the circuit. Compensated probes add a series resistor and capacitor network at the probe tip, forming a 10:1 voltage divider that balances the cable's capacitive loading with the probe tip's resistor-capacitor branch, significantly reducing the net capacitive load at the measurement point and preserving signal integrity for fast digital circuits.

9. **Q:** In the simplified digital MOSFET model, why is the switching resistance of the PMOS device typically three times larger than that of the NMOS device, and how is this reflected in the sizing ratios used in standard CMOS digital design layouts?  
   **A:** The PMOS device has approximately three times lower carrier mobility (holes vs. electrons) than the NMOS device, leading to a transconductance parameter KP roughly three times smaller, and consequently an effective switching resistance three times larger. To compensate, the PMOS transistor is typically sized about three times wider than the NMOS transistor in layouts (e.g., PMOS 30/1 vs. NMOS 10/1 drawn widths) to equalize drive strength and switching speeds in CMOS inverter and logic gate implementations.  
   **External example:** This mobility and sizing difference is standard in CMOS design texts, e.g., in “CMOS VLSI Design” by Weste and Harris: https://dl.acm.org/doi/book/10.5555/58015

10. **Q:** How does the intrinsic switching time constant τn for the processes described in this chapter translate numerically between long-channel and short-channel MOSFETs, and what practical conclusions can be drawn about scaling?  
    **A:** For the long-channel process (1 µm scale), τn ≈ 25 ps for NMOS devices, while in the short-channel process (50 nm scale), τn reduces significantly to about 2 ps, reflecting faster switching speeds due to reduced channel length and improved device operation. This scaling highlights that reducing feature size improves device speed roughly quadratically (long-channel) or linearly (short-channel) with channel length shrink, emphasizing the motivation for technology scaling in digital CMOS design.

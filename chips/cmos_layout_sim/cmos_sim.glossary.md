- **AC Analysis** — Simulation of circuit behavior when subjected to small sinusoidal signals across frequencies.  
- **ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter)** — A device that converts analog signals into digital form.  
- **AM (Amplitude Modulation)** — A technique where the amplitude of a signal is varied to encode information.  
- **Analog Design** — The creation of circuits that process continuous signals rather than discrete digital signals.  
- **Aperture Error** — Timing error in sample-and-hold circuits where the sample is not taken exactly at the intended moment.  
- **Bandgap Reference (BGR)** — A voltage reference circuit using the bandgap voltage of silicon to provide a stable output voltage.

- **Astable multivibrator** — A circuit with no stable state that continuously oscillates between high and low outputs.
- **Body effect** — The change in a MOSFET's threshold voltage caused by a difference in voltage between its body and source.
- **Buffer (Input buffer)** — A circuit that converts distorted or slow input signals into clean digital signals for on-chip use.
- **Charge pump (Voltage pump)** — A circuit that generates a DC voltage higher or lower than the supply voltage using capacitors and switches.
- **Comparator with hysteresis** — A comparator circuit that has two different switching thresholds to prevent output oscillations due to noise.
- **DC restore circuit** — A circuit that tracks the average value of an input signal to provide a dynamic reference voltage for slicing data.
- **Differential amplifier** — A circuit that amplifies the voltage difference between two inputs, commonly used for precise signal detection.
- **Hysteresis** — A characteristic of circuits (like the Schmitt trigger) where switching thresholds differ depending on the direction of input change.
- **Input capacitance** — The effective capacitive load seen at the input of a circuit that affects signal rise and fall times.
- **Latch-up** — A malfunction in CMOS circuits where parasitic structures cause a low-impedance path, potentially damaging the device.
- **Monostable multivibrator (One-shot)** — A circuit stable in only one state that produces a single output pulse of defined width in response to a trigger.
- **NMOS/PMOS MOSFET** — Types of MOS transistors formed by n-type or p-type regions, used to build CMOS circuits.
- **Oscillator** — A circuit that generates a periodic waveform automatically without an external input signal.
- **Propagation delay** — The time it takes for an input signal change to result in an output signal change in a circuit.
- **Schmitt trigger** — A comparator circuit with hysteresis used to convert noisy input signals into clean digital outputs.
- **Self-biased circuit** — A circuit that sets its operating current or voltage automatically without external references.
- **Signal skew** — The difference in timing between signals or within a signal due to unequal delay paths.
- **Substrate bias (Back bias)** — Applying a voltage to the substrate of a MOS transistor to adjust its threshold voltage or reduce leakage.
- **Voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO)** — An oscillator whose output frequency is controlled by an input voltage.
- **Voltage multiplier (Dickson charge pump)** — A circuit that generates high voltages by cascading capacitor and diode stages driven by clock signals.
- **Voltage threshold (VTH)** — The minimum gate-to-source voltage at which a MOSFET turns on.
- **Voltage swing** — The range between the highest and lowest voltage levels in a digital signal or circuit node.

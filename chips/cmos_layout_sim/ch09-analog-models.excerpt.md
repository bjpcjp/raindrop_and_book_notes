This chapter develops analog design models for MOSFET devices, covering long-channel MOSFETs with square-law equations, short-channel MOSFET characteristics and design trade-offs, and MOSFET noise modeling including thermal and flicker noise. It emphasizes the importance of device parameters such as transconductance, output resistance, threshold voltage variation, and transition frequency in small-signal and noise analyses, supported by simulations and examples for effective analog circuit design.

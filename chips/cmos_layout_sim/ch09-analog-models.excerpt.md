Chapter 9 develops analog design models for MOSFETs, covering long-channel devices based on square-law equations, short-channel devices with modern characteristics, and MOSFET noise modeling. It emphasizes key concepts such as device operation regions, small-signal parameters like transconductance and output resistance, temperature effects, and noise sources, providing both theoretical equations and simulation examples essential for analog circuit design.

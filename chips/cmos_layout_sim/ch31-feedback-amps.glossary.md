- **A0L (Open-loop gain)** — The gain of the basic amplifier without feedback, frequency dependent and ideally very large to achieve gain desensitivity.
- **ACL (Closed-loop gain)** — The gain of the amplifier with feedback applied; depends on A0L and the feedback factor ß, making gain stable and independent of device variations.
- **Active device** — A transistor or component providing gain; in feedback analysis, devices can be "taken out-of-socket" to determine loading.
- **Body effect** — The influence of the substrate bias on the transistor threshold voltage, affecting gain and linearity.
- **Feedback** — The process of combining the output of a system with its input, either positively or negatively.
- **Feedback amplifier** — The overall circuit formed by the combination of the basic amplifier and the feedback network.
- **Feedback factor (ß)** — The portion of the output fed back to the input; defined by the feedback network, it is unitless and critical for determining closed-loop performance.
- **Forward path** — The signal path from the input through the basic amplifier to the output in a feedback system.
- **Gain desensitivity** — A property whereby the closed-loop gain becomes insensitive to variations in open-loop gain due to feedback.
- **Gain margin** — The difference in gain at the frequency where the loop phase is 180°, indicating how close the system is to instability.
- **Input mixing** — The manner in which input signals combine at the amplifier input: either series (voltage) or shunt (current).
- **Input impedance (Ri)** — The resistance seen looking into the input of the amplifier or feedback amplifier; affected by feedback.
- **Loop gain** — The product of the open-loop gain and the feedback factor (A0Lß); used to assess stability.
- **Negative feedback** — Feedback where the output is subtracted from the input, stabilizing gain and reducing distortion and noise.
- **Open-loop analysis** — Analyzing the amplifier without the feedback loop closed to determine parameters like A0L, Ri, Ro, and ß.
- **Output sampling** — The method of extracting the output signal for feedback, either as a voltage (shunt) or current (series).
- **Output impedance (Ro)** — The resistance seen looking into the output of the amplifier or feedback amplifier; affected by feedback.
- **Phase margin** — The amount of additional phase shift at the gain crossover frequency required to bring the loop phase to -180°, used to quantify stability.
- **Positive feedback** — Feedback where the output is added to the input, potentially causing instability and oscillation.
- **Reference resistance (Rp/ Rβi, Rβo)** — Equivalent resistances representing feedback network loading at the input or output.
- **Return ratio (RR)** — A method of determining loop gain by breaking the feedback loop and injecting a test signal to measure returned gain.
- **Series mixing** — Input mixing where voltages are summed (subtracted) in series.
- **Shunt mixing** — Input mixing where currents are summed (subtracted) in parallel.
- **Shunt sampling** — Output sampling where voltage is sensed at a node shared by feedback and load (parallel connection).
- **Source-follower** — A transistor configuration often used at amplifier output for buffering and bias control.
- **Stability** — The attribute of an amplifier system to avoid oscillations; determined by loop gain magnitude and phase.
- **Transconductance amplifier** — An amplifier with input voltage signal and output current (I/V gain).
- **Transimpedance amplifier (TIA)** — An amplifier with input current signal and output voltage (V/I gain), often used for sensing currents like photodiodes.
- **Two-port theory** — A method of analyzing amplifier and feedback networks via input-output impedance relations, used to find feedback loading.
- **Voltage amplifier** — An amplifier with voltage as both input and output variables, typically with series-shunt feedback.
- **Voltage gain** — The ratio of output voltage to input voltage; can be controlled and stabilized via feedback.

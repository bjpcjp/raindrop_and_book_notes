- **A0L** — The open-loop gain of an amplifier, representing gain without feedback applied.  
- **ACL** — Closed-loop gain of an amplifier when feedback is applied, typically more stable and less sensitive to component variations.  
- **Beta (β)** — The feedback factor; the portion of the output fed back to the input, determining feedback strength and topology.  
- **Bandwidth Extension** — The increase in amplifier bandwidth achieved through negative feedback, trading off some gain.  
- **Closed-Loop Gain** — The amplifier gain when the feedback loop is closed, influenced by open-loop gain and feedback factor.  
- **Current Amplifier** — A feedback amplifier topology where input and output signals are currents, employing shunt-series feedback.  
- **Feedback** — The process of returning a portion of an amplifier’s output back to its input to control gain and stability.  
- **Feedback Amplifier** — An amplifier using feedback to improve performance characteristics like gain stability and bandwidth.  
- **Feedback Network (β Network)** — Circuit elements that sample the amplifier output and provide feedback signal to the input.  
- **Frequency Response** — How an amplifier's gain and phase vary with signal frequency, critical for stability analysis.  
- **Gain Margin** — The difference in gain at the frequency where phase shift is 180°, indicating stability margin.  
- **Gain Desensitivity** — Property whereby feedback reduces the effect of open-loop gain variation on the closed-loop gain.  
- **Input Mixing** — The method of combining input and feedback signals; can be series (voltage) or shunt (current).  
- **Loop Gain (T)** — The product of open-loop gain and feedback factor, used to analyze amplifier stability.  
- **Negative Feedback** — A feedback type where the output signal is subtracted from the input, stabilizing the system.  
- **Open-Loop Gain** — Amplifier gain without any feedback applied, often very high but sensitive to variations.  
- **Output Sampling** — How the output signal is sensed for feedback; can be series (current) or shunt (voltage).  
- **Phase Margin** — The difference between actual phase and -180° at the unity gain frequency, indicating stability.  
- **Return Ratio (RR)** — A method of determining loop gain by breaking the feedback loop and measuring returned signal.  
- **Series Mixing** — Input signal and feedback signal combined by voltage subtraction (series connection).  
- **Shunt Mixing** — Input signal and feedback signal combined by current subtraction (parallel connection).  
- **Shunt Sampling** — Output signal for feedback taken as voltage at a node common to amplifier output and feedback network.  
- **Series Sampling** — Output signal for feedback taken as current in series with load and feedback network.  
- **Tansconductance Amplifier** — An amplifier with voltage input and current output using series-series feedback topology.  
- **Transimpedance Amplifier** — An amplifier with current input and voltage output using shunt-shunt feedback topology.  
- **Stability** — The property of a feedback amplifier to avoid oscillations, ensured by proper phase and gain margins.  
- **Total Loop Gain** — The combined gain and phase of the feedback loop, crucial for determining feedback amplifier behavior.  
- **Voltage Amplifier** — An amplifier with voltage input and output, typified by series-shunt feedback configuration.

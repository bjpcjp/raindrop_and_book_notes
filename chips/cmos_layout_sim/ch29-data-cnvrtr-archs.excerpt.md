Chapter 29 provides a comprehensive overview of various data converter architectures, including resistor-string and R-2R ladder DACs, current steering and charge-scaling DACs, cyclic and pipeline DACs, as well as Flash, two-step Flash, pipeline, integrating, successive approximation, and oversampling ADCs. Each architecture’s operational principles, advantages, limitations, and accuracy considerations—such as component matching, offset voltages, and noise shaping—are discussed in detail to guide design choices for higher speed and resolution converters.

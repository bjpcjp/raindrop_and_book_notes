Chapter 29 reviews various data converter architectures, detailing DAC types such as resistor-string, R-2R ladder, current-steering, charge-scaling, cyclic, pipeline, and oversampling designs, along with their advantages, limitations, and accuracy considerations. It also covers ADC architectures including Flash, two-step Flash, pipeline, integrating, successive approximation, and oversampling ADCs, emphasizing their operational principles, performance factors like nonlinearity and offset errors, and the role of components such as amplifiers and comparators in determining overall converter accuracy.

This excerpt introduces CMOS integrated circuit design, emphasizing the process from defining inputs and outputs through layout, simulation, fabrication, and testing, with a focus on custom IC design and the importance of understanding parasitics. It also provides a foundational overview of SPICE simulation for circuit analysis, including operating point, transfer function, and DC analysis, illustrating these concepts with practical examples.

- **Avalanche noise** — Noise generated in a reverse-biased pn junction when carriers gain enough energy to dislodge additional electron-hole pairs, causing multiplication of current; typically white noise with PSD around 10⁻¹⁶ V²/Hz.  
- **Average power** — The mean power dissipated over one cycle or measurement period, calculated by averaging instantaneous power; for sinusoidal signals, power relates to RMS voltage squared divided by resistance.  
- **Bandpass filter** — A filter that passes frequencies within a certain range (bandwidth fres) and attenuates frequencies outside that range, used in spectrum analyzers.  
- **Bandwidth (B)** — Frequency range over which noise or signal power is measured, equal to f_H - f_L; used to calculate RMS noise from PSD.  
- **Cascade noise** — Total noise in a series of amplifiers, where the noise of the first stage has the largest impact on overall noise performance.  
- **Correlation** — Statistical relationship between two signals; if noise sources are correlated, their powers cannot simply be summed, affecting total noise calculations.  
- **Complex input impedance** — A non-real input impedance (Z_in) with resistive and reactive components, affecting noise and power transfer calculations.  
- **Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)** — A mathematical transformation of analog waveforms into spectral components analogous to spectrum analyzer measurements.  
- **Energy (Joule)** — Sum of instantaneous power over time; total energy supplied (W·s), not mean power.  
- **Excess noise (flicker noise)** — Low-frequency noise present in resistors or interfaces when current flows, characterized by a 1/f PSD, different from thermal noise.  
- **Input-referred noise** — Noise measured at the output of a circuit referenced back to the input for comparison with input signals; modeled using equivalent noise voltage and/or current sources.  
- **Mean-squared value** — The average of the square of a noise signal over time, representing power; used in RMS voltage calculations.  
- **Measurement bandwidth** — The resolution bandwidth (f_res) of a spectrum analyzer at which power spectral densities are defined.  
- **Noise equivalent bandwidth (NEB)** — The effective bandwidth of a system or filter that accounts for roll-off, used to calculate RMS noise from PSD.  
- **Noise figure (NF)** — A measure (in dB) of how much a circuit degrades the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR); NF = 0 dB for a noiseless amplifier.  
- **Noise floor** — The minimum detectable noise level of a measurement instrument or circuit.  
- **Noise temperature (Tn)** — Equivalent temperature that represents the noise added by the amplifier when referred to the input; relates noise factor to thermal noise.  
- **Power spectral density (PSD)** — Power per unit frequency content of a signal or noise, commonly with units V²/Hz or A²/Hz; used for noise analysis.  
- **Random telegraph signal (RTS) noise** — Noise appearing as discrete bursts or steps over time, caused by trap sites affecting carrier diffusion; PSD rolls off above certain frequencies.  
- **Root-mean-squared (RMS) voltage** — Square root of mean-squared voltage; represents the equivalent DC voltage that would dissipate the same power.  
- **Shot noise** — Noise due to the discrete and random movement of charge carriers across a potential barrier, proportional to the DC current; white spectrum.  
- **Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)** — Ratio of signal power to noise power, often expressed in dB; a key metric for system performance.  
- **Spectrum analyzer (SA)** — Instrument that measures signal spectral content by frequency-shifting, filtering, and power measurement; plots PSD vs. frequency.  
- **Thermal noise (Johnson noise)** — Noise caused by thermal motion of electrons in resistors; white noise PSD = 4kTR (V²/Hz).  
- **White noise** — Noise with constant power spectral density across frequency; includes thermal and shot noise.  
- **1/f noise (Flicker noise)** — Noise with PSD inversely proportional to frequency, dominating low frequencies; also called pink noise or pink flicker noise.

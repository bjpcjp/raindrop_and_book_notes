- **Avalanche Noise** — Noise caused by carrier multiplication in a reverse-biased pn junction due to high electric fields.  
- **Average Power** — The mean power dissipated over one cycle of a periodic signal, often calculated as mean-square voltage divided by resistance.  
- **Bandwidth (B)** — The frequency range over which noise or signals are measured or considered.  
- **Block Diagram** — A simplified illustration showing the functional relationships and flows in an electrical instrument or circuit.  
- **Cascaded Amplifiers** — Multiple amplifiers connected in series, where the first stage’s noise dominates overall noise performance.  
- **Capacitance Noise (kT/C Noise)** — Thermal noise voltage on a capacitor due to its finite size, proportional to temperature and inversely proportional to capacitance.  
- **Correlation** — Measure of how two signals or noise sources relate, affecting the total noise power when they are combined.  
- **Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)** — A mathematical tool to convert time-domain signals into frequency-domain for spectrum analysis.  
- **Flicker Noise (1/f Noise)** — Low-frequency noise with a power spectral density inversely proportional to frequency, dominant at low frequencies in CMOS devices.  
- **Gain-Bandwidth Product (f_m)** — Frequency at which an amplifier's open-loop gain drops to unity; used to determine closed-loop bandwidth.  
- **Input-Referred Noise** — Noise at a circuit’s output mathematically referenced back to the input for comparison with input signals.  
- **Integral Noise (Red Noise)** — Noise with PSD proportional to 1/f², such as the output noise of an integrator driven by thermal noise.  
- **Mean-Squared Voltage** — The average of the square of a voltage signal, used to compute power or noise intensity.  
- **Noise Equivalent Bandwidth (NEB)** — Bandwidth of an ideal filter that passes the same noise power as the actual filter has in the circuit.  
- **Noise Factor (F)** — Ratio of total output noise power to the noise contribution from the source resistor only.  
- **Noise Figure (NF)** — Noise factor expressed in decibels, indicating how much a circuit degrades the signal-to-noise ratio.  
- **Noise Power Spectral Density (PSD)** — Distribution of noise power across frequency, typically in V²/Hz or A²/Hz.  
- **Noise Temperature (T_n)** — Equivalent temperature of a noise source that produces the same noise power as the amplifier's noise contribution.  
- **Optimum Source Resistance (R_s,opt)** — The source resistance value that minimizes the overall noise factor of a system.  
- **Power Spectral Density (PSD)** — See Noise Power Spectral Density.  
- **Random Telegraph Signal (RTS) Noise** — Bursty noise characterized by discrete switching events causing intermittent bursts in time domain, with a specific PSD roll-off.  
- **Root-Mean-Squared (RMS) Voltage** — Square root of the mean-squared voltage, representing the effective voltage of an AC or noise signal.  
- **Shot Noise** — Noise caused by discrete charge carriers crossing a potential barrier with current flow, proportional to the DC current.  
- **Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)** — Ratio of desired signal power to noise power, often expressed in decibels (dB).  
- **Spectrum Analyzer (SA)** — Instrument that measures and displays the power spectral density of a signal.  
- **Thermal Noise (Johnson-Nyquist Noise)** — Noise generated by the random thermal motion of carriers in a resistor, constant across frequency (white noise).  
- **White Noise** — Noise with constant power spectral density across frequency.

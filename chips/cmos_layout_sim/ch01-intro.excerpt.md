This chapter introduces CMOS integrated circuit design, covering the design process from specification and simulation using SPICE to layout, fabrication, and testing, emphasizing the importance of understanding parasitics and device behavior. It also provides a detailed overview of SPICE simulation techniques for analyzing circuits through operating point, DC, AC, transient analyses, and modeling elements like switches, op-amps, and sources.

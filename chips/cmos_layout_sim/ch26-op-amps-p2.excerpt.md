This chapter discusses the design of fully-differential operational amplifiers (op-amps) with common-mode feedback (CMFB) circuits optimized for high-speed, low-power CMOS processes. It covers practical aspects such as device biasing, offset modeling, CMFB stability and compensation, gain enhancement techniques, and both continuous-time and switched-capacitor CMFB implementations to achieve balanced outputs and improved op-amp performance in nanometer-scale CMOS technology.

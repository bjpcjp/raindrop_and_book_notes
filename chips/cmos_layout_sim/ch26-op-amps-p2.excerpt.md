This chapter focuses on the design of fully-differential operational amplifiers (op-amps) and common-mode feedback (CMFB) circuits optimized for high-speed, low-power CMOS processes, specifically using a 50 nm technology with 1 V supply. It covers practical design considerations, including biasing strategies, offset modeling, CMFB stability and compensation, and switched-capacitor CMFB implementation, culminating in detailed examples of op-amp topologies, simulations, and techniques to balance gain, speed, power, and output common-mode control.

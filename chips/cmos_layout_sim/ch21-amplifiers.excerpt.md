This chapter explores various single-stage CMOS amplifier configurations including common-source, common-gate, and source-follower topologies with gate-drain and current source loads, analyzing their gain, frequency response, noise performance, and trade-offs such as Miller effect and pole splitting. It also examines advanced structures like cascode and push-pull amplifiers, addressing biasing techniques, distortion characterization, and the importance of feedback and output buffering for power efficiency and linearity in practical circuit designs.

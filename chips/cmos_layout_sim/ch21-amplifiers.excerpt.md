This chapter discusses various single-stage CMOS amplifier configurations, focusing on the trade-offs between gate-drain-connected loads and current source loads, and their effects on gain, frequency response, noise performance, and distortion. Detailed analyses include common-source, common-gate, and source-follower amplifiers, as well as cascode and push-pull topologies, emphasizing design considerations such as Miller effect, pole splitting, output buffering, power efficiency, and stability issues associated with right-half plane zeros.

- **AOI logic (And-Or-Invert)** — A CMOS logic style that implements combinational logic functions by combining AND and OR gates followed by an inverter.  
- **Cload (Load Capacitance)** — The total capacitance connected to the output node of a logic gate excluding intrinsic device capacitances.  
- **CMOS (Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor)** — A technology for constructing integrated circuits using complementary and symmetrical pairs of p-type and n-type MOSFETs.  
- **CVSL (Cascode Voltage Switch Logic)** — A differential logic style using cross-connected PMOS loads and NMOS logic to improve switching speed.  
- **Delay (Propagation Delay)** — The time taken for an input change to cause a corresponding output change in a logic gate, often measured as tPLH or tPHL.  
- **Differential Logic** — A logic style where complementary output signals are employed, often improving noise immunity and speed.  
- **DSL (Differential Split-Level Logic)** — A logic scheme reducing output voltage swing to speed up switching at the cost of smaller noise margins and increased power.  
- **Effective Resistance (of MOSFETs)** — Approximate equivalent resistance of MOSFET transistors used to analyze delay or switching characteristics in circuits.  
- **High-to-Low Delay (tPHL)** — The time delay for an output to transition from a high logic level to a low logic level.  
- **Input Capacitance** — Capacitance seen at the input terminal of a transistor or logic gate, affecting switching speed.  
- **Low-to-High Delay (tPLH)** — The time delay for an output to transition from a low logic level to a high logic level.  
- **MOSFET (Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistor)** — A transistor used in CMOS technology to switch or amplify signals, including NMOS and PMOS types.  
- **NAND Gate** — A logic gate producing a low output only when all inputs are high; implemented in CMOS with NMOS devices in series and PMOS in parallel.  
- **NMOS Transistor** — A type of MOSFET using electrons as charge carriers; typically faster than PMOS due to higher electron mobility.  
- **Normal Mode Operation (Static Logic)** — Logic operation where outputs are always valid functions of inputs at all times, as opposed to dynamic logic.  
- **NOR Gate** — A logic gate producing a high output only when all inputs are low; implemented in CMOS with PMOS devices in series and NMOS in parallel.  
- **Pass Gate** — A transmission gate using NMOS and/or PMOS transistors to pass logic signals, with limited voltage swing depending on transistor type.  
- **Parallel MOSFET Connection** — MOSFETs connected side-by-side sharing the same gate input, effectively increasing device width and reducing resistance.  
- **Propagation Delay** — The delay time before an output responds to an input change in a logic gate.  
- **Series MOSFET Connection** — MOSFETs connected end-to-end which increases the effective channel length and resistance, impacting delay.  
- **Switching Point Voltage (Vsp)** — The input voltage at which a CMOS gate's output switches logic state; ideal value is near half the supply voltage.  
- **Tri-State Buffer** — A buffer circuit with an output that can be driven high, low, or placed in a high-impedance state to disconnect from the line.  
- **VDD** — The positive supply voltage for CMOS circuits.  
- **VTHN (NMOS Threshold Voltage)** — The minimum gate-to-source voltage required to turn on an NMOS transistor.  
- **VTHP (PMOS Threshold Voltage)** — The minimum gate-to-source voltage magnitude required to turn on a PMOS transistor.  
- **Voltage Transfer Curve (VTC)** — A graph showing the output voltage of a gate as a function of input voltage, used to analyze logic gate behavior.

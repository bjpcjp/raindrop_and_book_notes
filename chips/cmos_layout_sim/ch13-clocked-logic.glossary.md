- **Arbiter** — A circuit used in asynchronous and clock synchronization designs to determine which of multiple inputs arrives first, ensuring only one output is high at a time.
- **Capacitance on S input (TG)** — Input capacitance of the transmission gate’s NMOS or PMOS devices affecting the select line delay.
- **Clear time** — Time related to asynchronous input in flip-flops to forcibly reset the output.
- **Cross-coupled inverters** — A pair of inverters connected in a loop, used as the basic memory element in latches and flip-flops.
- **D flip-flop (D-FF)** — A storage circuit that captures the input data on a clock edge and holds it until the next clock edge.
- **Delay (propagation delay)** — The time it takes for a signal to propagate from input to output in a circuit element.
- **Edge-triggered flip-flop** — A flip-flop that changes state only on the rising or falling edge of a clock signal.
- **Enable TG (Transmission Gate)** — The control select line that enables or disables signal passage through the TG.
- **Flow-through latch** — A level-sensitive storage element whose output follows the input when enabled by a clock signal.
- **Hold time (th)** — The minimum duration after the clock edge during which input data must remain stable.
- **Input capacitance** — The capacitance seen at the input node of a transistor or logic gate, affecting input signal rise/fall times.
- **Load capacitance (Cload)** — The total capacitance a circuit stage must drive, including device and wiring capacitances.
- **Metastability** — A condition where a latch or flip-flop is temporarily unstable, causing long delays before resolving to a valid logic state.
- **Minimum pulse width (tn)** — The shortest pulse duration of clock, set, or clear inputs that a flip-flop can reliably detect.
- **Multiplexer (MUX)** — A circuit that selects one input out of many based on control signals and passes it to the output.
- **NMOS pass gate (PG)** — An NMOS transistor used to pass a signal, good at passing logic low but not high.
- **Recovery time (trec)** — The minimum time interval between removing set or clear inputs and applying the next valid clock input.
- **Resistance of TG (Rn || Rp)** — The effective resistance of parallel NMOS and PMOS within a transmission gate controlling delay.
- **Setup time (ts)** — The minimum time before the clock edge that data input must be stable to guarantee correct flip-flop operation.
- **Set-reset (SR) latch** — A bistable device implemented using NAND or NOR gates to store a single bit with separate set and reset signals.
- **Static gate using TG** — Logic gates designed with transmission gates to implement functions like OR, XOR with improved signal levels.
- **Switching resistance (effective)** — The equivalent resistance of a transistor when on,

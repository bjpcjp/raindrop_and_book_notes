This chapter discusses the design and analysis of voltage references in CMOS circuits, focusing on MOSFET-resistor and parasitic diode-based approaches to generate stable reference voltages with minimal sensitivity to supply voltage, temperature, and process variations. It highlights key circuits such as resistor-MOSFET dividers, self-biased beta-multiplier references, and bandgap references that combine proportional-to-absolute-temperature (PTAT) and complementary-to-absolute-temperature (CTAT) behaviors to achieve temperature compensation.

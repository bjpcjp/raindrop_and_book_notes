This chapter discusses the design and analysis of voltage references in CMOS circuits, focusing on MOSFET-resistor and parasitic diode-based approaches to achieve stable reference voltages independent of power supply, temperature, and process variations. It covers fundamental concepts such as PTAT, CTAT, and bandgap references, including self-biased circuits, current mirrors, and practical considerations like temperature coefficients, start-up circuits, and lower-voltage implementations for modern CMOS processes.

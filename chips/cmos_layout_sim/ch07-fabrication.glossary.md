- **Annealing** — Heating a material to repair crystal damage and activate dopants after implantation.  
- **BEOL (Backend of the Line)** — CMOS processes after transistor formation, mainly metal/dielectric interconnect layers.  
- **CMP (Chemical Mechanical Polishing)** — A planarization process using chemical slurry and mechanical polishing.  
- **Contact** — Electrical connection between metal layers and underlying silicon or polysilicon.  
- **Czochralski (CZ) Growth** — Method of growing single crystal silicon boule from molten silicon using a seed crystal.  
- **Diffusion** — Heat-driven process that spreads dopants in silicon to adjust electrical properties.  
- **Dry Oxidation** — Thermal oxidation of silicon using oxygen gas to form high-quality silicon dioxide layer.  
- **Dry Etching** — Material removal using plasma or ion bombardment, often anisotropic for precise pattern transfer.  
- **Epitaxial (Epi) Wafer** — Silicon wafer with a thin, lightly doped silicon layer grown on heavily doped substrate.  
- **FEOL (Frontend of the Line)** — CMOS processes to create isolated transistors before metallization.  
- **Ion Implantation** — Process to inject dopant ions into silicon using accelerated ion beams for controlled doping.  
- **LDD (Low Doped Drain)** — Lightly doped source/drain extensions reducing hot carrier effects in CMOS devices.  
- **LOCOS (LOCal Oxidation of Silicon)** — Isolation technique using patterned silicon nitride to grow field oxide, causing bird’s beak encroachment.  
- **Mask (Photomask)** — Patterned quartz plate used in photolithography to define circuit features on photoresist.  
- **Numerical Aperture (NA)** — A measure of a lens’s light-gathering ability affecting photolithography resolution.  
- **Oxidant Concentration** — The amount of reactive species like O2 or H2O at various interfaces during thermal oxidation.  
- **PECVD (Plasma Enhanced CVD)** — Chemical vapor deposition using plasma to lower deposition temperature.  
- **Photolithography** — Technique using UV light, masks, and light-sensitive polymers to pattern wafers.  
- **Photoresist** — Light-sensitive polymer coating used in photolithography to transfer circuit patterns.  
- **PVD (Physical Vapor Deposition)** — Thin film deposition through physical evaporation or sputtering of source materials.  
- **RIE (Reactive Ion Etching)** — Dry etch combining chemical and physical ion bombardment for anisotropic etching.  
- **Shallow Trench Isolation (STI)** — Isolation method using etched trenches filled with dielectric material to separate devices.  
- **Silicide (Salicide)** — Compound of silicon and metal (e.g., TiSi2, CoSi2) formed on polysilicon and source/drain to reduce resistance.  
- **Spacer (Sidewall Spacer)** — Dielectric layer around gate edges used to define source/drain implant boundaries.  
- **Step Coverage** — The ability of deposited films to uniformly coat surface topography including vertical sidewalls.  
- **Straggle (ΔRp)** — The standard deviation of an ion implant doping profile, indicating spread in depth.  
- **Via** — Vertical electrical connection between metal layers in multilayer interconnects.  
- **Wafers** — Thin slices of single crystallline silicon on which integrated circuits are built.  
- **Wet Oxidation** — Thermal oxidation of silicon using water vapor resulting in faster but less dense oxide growth.  
- **Wet Etching** — Chemical etching process using liquid solutions, generally isotropic and highly selective.

- **Active-PI Loop Filter** — A loop filter with proportional and integral components that improves DPLL lock performance and reduces static phase error by allowing VCO control voltage to move away from midpoint.
- **Bi-phase Encoding** — A data encoding scheme where each bit contains at least one transition, providing a 50% duty cycle to ease clock recovery.
- **Charge Pump** — A current-output device used in PFD-based DPLLs to offer supply-independent control currents and reduce VCO control voltage modulation.
- **Current-Starved VCO** — A voltage-controlled oscillator where inverter stages are limited by current sources, thereby controlling oscillation frequency through input voltage.
- **DPLL (Digital Phase-Locked Loop)** — A circuit synchronizing a generated clock to an incoming digital data signal by locking phases using digital phase detectors, loop filters, and a VCO.
- **DLL (Delay-Locked Loop)** — A timing synchronization system that uses a voltage-controlled delay line instead of a VCO to reduce jitter caused by oscillator noise.
- **Edge Detector** — Circuit detecting transitions in NRZ digital data, converting data edges to pulses enabling XOR-based DPLL to lock on NRZ data.
- **Frequency Synthesis** — Generating a clock at a multiple of an input reference frequency by dividing the VCO output frequency in a DPLL.
- **Gain (Kp or Kvco)** — Sensitivity of phase detector (Kp) or VCO (Kvco) quantified as output change per unit phase difference (volts/radian) or input voltage (radians/sec/V).
- **Hogge Phase Detector** — A self-correcting phase detector used in clock-recovery DPLLs that aligns clock edge to center of NRZ data bit by comparing delayed data samples.
- **Jitter** — Variation in timing of clock edges once a loop is locked, caused by ripple on control voltage or noise sources.
- **Lock Range** — The frequency range around nominal frequency over which a DPLL can maintain phase lock without slipping.
- **Lock Time** — Time required for a DPLL or DLL to achieve phase lock after frequency or phase changes.
- **Loop Filter** — Circuit (passive or active) that filters output of phase detector in DPLL/DLL to control dynamics and stability of the loop.
- **NRZ (Non-Return to Zero)** — A data format where logical levels are represented by steady voltage levels without inherent timing transitions.
- **Phase Detector (PD)** — Device in DPLL comparing phase (and sometimes frequency) of input data and feedback clock, outputting error signal proportional to phase difference.
- **Phase Frequency Detector (PFD)** — A PD that detects both phase and frequency differences, outputs up/down pulses and avoids lock on harmonics, usually combined with charge pump.
- **Pull-in Range** — Range of input frequencies from which a DPLL can achieve lock, typically wider but takes longer than lock range.
- **Ripple** — Unwanted oscillation or variation in the control voltage of the VCO caused by phase detector output switching or loop filter characteristics.
- **Tri-state Output** — Phase detector output configuration with high, low, and high-impedance states, used to drive loop filters but sensitive to supply noise.
- **Voltage-Controlled Delay Line (VCDL)** — A chain of delay elements whose total delay is controlled by input voltage, used in DLLs for fine timing adjustment.
- **Voltage-Controlled Oscillator (VCO)** — Oscillator whose oscillation frequency is controlled by an input voltage, key component in DPLL.
- **Voltage-Controlled Resistor Linearization** — A technique to make MOS transistor currents (and thereby VCO gain) more linear with respect to control voltage.
- **XOR Phase Detector** — Simple phase detector using XOR logic gate whose output average duty cycle is proportional to phase error, but can lock on harmonics and has limitations on data patterns.

- **Buffer** — A cascade of inverters designed to drive large capacitive loads with minimum delay by progressively increasing device sizes.  
- **Capacitance, Input (Cin)** — The effective input capacitance of an inverter, primarily the sum of gate oxide capacitances of the MOSFETs.  
- **Capacitance, Load (Cload)** — The total capacitance loaded at the output of a gate, including interconnect and input capacitances of subsequent gates.  
- **Capacitance, Output (Cout)** — The output capacitance of an inverter, including drain-bulk capacitances and device parasitics.  
- **Dynamic Power Dissipation** — The power dissipated by a CMOS inverter during switching, proportional to the load capacitance, supply voltage squared, and clock frequency.  
- **Input Logic Thresholds (VIL, VIH)** — Voltages defining the valid logic low (VIL) and logic high (VIH) input levels based on inverter transfer characteristics at slope = -1 points.  
- **Intrinsic Propagation Delay** — The delay associated with charging or discharging internal parasitic capacitances of an inverter without additional load.  
- **Latch-up** — A parasitic thyristor effect caused by unintended bipolar transistors formed in CMOS substrates, potentially causing a device to lock in a high-current state.  
- **Load Buffering** — The process of using multiple inverters (buffers) in a cascade to drive large capacitive loads efficiently by balancing delay and device sizing.  
- **Noise Margin** — The tolerance of a digital gate to noise on its input or output signals, defined separately for high (NMH) and low (NML) logic levels.  
- **NMOS-Only Output Driver** — An output buffer using only NMOS devices to avoid latch-up, often with reduced output voltage swing unless boosted by additional circuitry.  
- **Output Voltage Swing (VOH, VOL)** — The maximum (VOH) and minimum (VOL) output voltages an inverter can produce, ideally equal to VDD and ground, respectively.  
- **Power Delay Product (PDP)** — A figure of merit for digital circuits defined as the product of average power dissipation and propagation delay, measuring energy efficiency.  
- **Propagation Delay (tpLH, tpHL)** — The time it takes for an inverter output to transition from low to high (tpLH) or high to low (tpHL) in response to an input change.  
- **Ring Oscillator** — A circuit formed by an odd number of inverters connected in a loop, used to measure delay and frequency characteristics of a process.  
- **Switching Point Voltage (Vsp)** — The input voltage at which the inverter output voltage equals the input voltage, typically where both NMOS and PMOS devices conduct equally.  
- **Switching Threshold** — The voltage level at which an inverter toggles its output state; often adjusted by device sizing to improve noise margins.  
- **Tri-State Output** — An inverter configuration that can drive the output to logic high, logic low, or high impedance (Hi-Z), enabling data bus sharing.  
- **Width Ratio (W_p/W_n)** — The relative size scaling between PMOS and NMOS transistors in an inverter to achieve symmetric switching characteristics and balanced drive strength.  
- **Zero Static Power Dissipation** — A characteristic of CMOS inverters indicating negligible power consumption in steady logic states due to no direct path between VDD and ground.

1. **Q:** Explain the significance of the switching point voltage (Vsp) in CMOS NAND and NOR gates, and why NAND gates are generally preferred in CMOS digital design.
   **A:** The switching point voltage (Vsp) is the input voltage at which the output of a logic gate switches its logic state. For NAND gates, NMOS transistors are in series and PMOS transistors are in parallel, while for NOR gates, PMOS are in series and NMOS in parallel. This topology makes the NAND gate’s Vsp closer to the ideal midpoint (VDD/2) due to the higher mobility of electrons in NMOS devices, resulting in better noise margins and dynamic characteristics. For example, a minimum-size three-input NAND gate has a Vsp closer to 2.9 V compared to the NOR gate’s 1.33 V (assuming VDD=5V), making NAND gates more reliable for digital logic.
   **External example:** The preferred use of NAND gates in CMOS design due to better switching characteristics is also discussed in “CMOS VLSI Design” by Weste and Harris (Pearson, 2011), Chapter 3. https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~imarkov/courses/michigan/ECE472/CMOS_VLSI_3e_Chapter3.pdf

2. **Q:** Describe how the series and parallel connection of MOSFETs affects the propagation delay in CMOS static logic gates and summarize the simplified equations used for delay estimation in NAND gates.
   **A:** In CMOS gates, MOSFETs in parallel behave like a single transistor with cumulative width, reducing resistance and thus delay, calculated as tpLH ≈ 0.7 * Rp * (N*Coxp + Cload) for PMOS in parallel. For series-connected MOSFETs, effective channel length increases multiplicatively, raising resistance and delay, approximated by tpHL ≈ 0.7 * N * Rn * Cload (assuming large load). For an n-input NAND gate with all inputs switching simultaneously, the low-to-high delay involves parallel PMOS devices, and high-to-low involves series NMOS devices; simplified delays when only one input switches are tpHL ≈ 0.7 * N * Rn * Cload and tpLH ≈ 0.7 * Rp * Cload.
   **External example:** Timing analysis of MOSFET series and parallel connections in CMOS is explained in “Digital Integrated Circuits” by Jan M. Rabaey et al., which uses similar approximations to estimate gate delays. https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4220918

3. **Q:** How does the number of inputs (N) in a static CMOS NAND or NOR gate affect its practical implementation, and what alternative circuit configuration is proposed for gates with a large number of inputs?
   **A:** As N increases, series-connected devices (in NOR gates for PMOS or NAND gates for NMOS) make the gate slow due to increased resistance and capacitance, leading to unacceptably long delays and increased transistor count (2N devices). For very large N (like 100 inputs), this is impractical. An alternative is to use a configuration with N+1 transistors, where NMOS devices are all in parallel pulling the output low if any input is high, and a single long-channel PMOS device pulls the output high when all inputs are low. This reduces transistor count but results in a large pull-up resistance and high pull-up time.
   **External example:** The problem of large input NAND/NOR gate implementation is well documented in “CMOS Circuit Design, Layout, and Simulation” by Rabaey, linking to use of transmission gates or alternative topologies for large-input gates. https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-94-009-8023-5_12

4. **Q:** What are the advantages of implementing complex Boolean functions using And-Or-Invert (AOI) logic in CMOS, and how does it compare to implementing the same function with basic NAND or NOR gates?
   **A:** AOI logic implementations reduce the number of logic stages and transistors for complex functions by combining AND and OR operations followed by inversion, effectively lowering delay and output capacitance. AOI logic places parallel NMOS devices closer to ground for faster pull-down and smaller output capacitance, resulting in improved speed and efficiency compared to multiple cascaded NAND or NOR gates. The AOI configuration produces the complement of the function, sometimes requiring a final inverter.
   **External example:** AOI logic benefits and implementations are standard in CMOS design and detailed in "CMOS VLSI Design" by Neil Weste and David Harris. https://ptgmedia.pearsoncmg.com/images/9780136079693/samplepages/0136079697.pdf

5. **Q:** Explain the CMOS implementation of an XOR gate using AOI logic, including the Boolean algebra transformations used, and summarize the complementary transistor network configuration.
   **A:** The XOR gate function Z = A ⊕ B can be expressed as Z = (A + B)(A̅ + B̅) = A B̅ + A̅ B through Boolean transformations. The AOI CMOS implementation uses complementary pull-up (PMOS) and pull-down (NMOS) networks that realize the product-of-sums and sum-of-products expressions respectively. This results in a transistor arrangement where PMOS devices are configured in parallel-series to implement (A + B)(A̅ + B̅) and NMOS devices in series-parallel to implement A B̅ + A̅ B, allowing full complementary functionality.
   **External example:** The AOI CMOS XOR structure is explained in "Digital Integrated Circuits" by Jan M. Rabaey, with transistor-level diagrams showing the complementary networks. https://web.stanford.edu/class/ee214/lecture3.pdf

6. **Q:** Describe the operation and delay characteristics of a CMOS tri-state buffer as presented, including how the enable signal controls the output and the advantages over simple inverter buffers.
   **A:** The tri-state buffer uses NAND and NOR gates to invert and pass the input A to the gates of two complementary transistors Ml (NMOS) and M2 (PMOS). When Enable is high, Ml and M2 operate as an inverter, driving the output to the level of A. When Enable is low, both Ml and M2 are off, placing the output in a high-impedance (Hi-Z) state, effectively disconnecting it from the circuit. This design has only one transistor in series with the output, reducing delay compared to other tri-state implementations. It is suitable for driving loads with controlled propagation delays.
   **External example:** Detailed explanations of CMOS tri-state buffers and their delays are provided by Texas Instruments datasheets on buffer ICs with Enable inputs. https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/sn74hc125.pdf

7. **Q:** What are the specific delay trade-offs involved in using Cascode Voltage Switch Logic (CVSL) compared to AOI logic in CMOS circuits?
   **A:** CVSL implements differential logic via cross-coupled PMOS loads and NMOS logic blocks for signals and their complements, offering potentially faster switching due to positive feedback. However, CVSL gates experience contention current when switching, as the cross-coupled loads allow current to flow through conducting PMOS devices before switching is complete. Mitigating contention requires lengthening PMOS devices to increase resistance, increasing delay. AOI logic does not have such contention but may have more stages, so CVSL can be faster in certain scenarios but with power penalty.
   **External example:** The trade-offs of CVSL vs. other CMOS logic styles are covered in “Digital Integrated Circuits” by Jan M. Rabaey et al., describing power and delay trade-offs. https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/460873

8. **Q:** How does Differential Split-Level Logic (DSL) reduce output voltage swing and what is the primary disadvantage of this approach in CMOS static logic design?
   **A:** DSL logic sets the reference voltage on transistor gates to VDD/2 + VTHN, limiting the output voltage swing between VDD and approximately VDD/2 rather than from full rail to rail. This reduced swing speeds up switching times due to lower voltage swings and reduced load charging times. However, because the output node is held at an intermediate voltage (VDD/2), continuous current flows through the output leg, increasing static power dissipation, which is disadvantageous for low-power CMOS design.
   **External example:** Reduced swing logic and its associated power implications are described in “Low-Power CMOS VLSI Design” by Anantha Chandrakasan et al. https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/low-power-cmos-vlsi-design

9. **Q:** Using the provided analysis, compare the expected switching delays when one input switches versus when all inputs switch simultaneously in a three-input NAND gate driving a 50 fF load.
   **A:** When all three inputs switch simultaneously, the low-to-high propagation delay (tpLH) involves three PMOS devices in parallel, and high-to-low delay (tpHL) involves three NMOS devices in series, resulting in longer delays: approximately 43 ps tpLH and 393 ps tpHL in the short-channel process example. When only one input switches, the low-to-high delay is reduced, as only one PMOS transistor pulls the output high (119 ps), while the high-to-low delay is less affected by input count because the NMOS devices in series still impact discharge; the delay remains about 357 ps. Thus, worst-case delays occur with all inputs switching, but practically single input transitions dominate.
   **External example:** The difference in delays based on switching conditions in CMOS gates is discussed in “CMOS Digital Integrated Circuits: Analysis and Design” by Sung-Mo Kang and Yusuf Leblebici. https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/cmos-digital-integrated-circuits/9921ACB9B19D5AA14E0FE57AC805B707

10. **Q:** Outline the key steps in the AOI CMOS full adder design, detailing the Boolean expressions for sum and carry and how these translate into transistor configurations.
    **A:** The full adder sum output is given by S = A ⊕ B ⊕ C, which can be rewritten using sum-of-products: S = (A + B + C)•Cout + A•B•C, where Cout = AB + C(A + B). The carry output is expressed as Cout = AB + C(A + B). These expressions lend themselves to AOI CMOS designs by mapping the sum-of-products to NMOS pull-down and PMOS pull-up networks that implement inverted AND-OR logic, with the complementary pull-ups and pull-downs made of series and parallel transistors corresponding to the logic terms. This reduces transistor count and delay compared to separate XOR and AND-OR gate implementations.

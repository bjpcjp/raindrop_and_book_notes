This chapter provides an overview of CMOS process integration, detailing the fundamental unit processes such as wafer manufacture, thermal oxidation, doping, photolithography, thin-film removal and deposition, which are combined in sequence to fabricate CMOS integrated circuits. It further describes a representative modern CMOS process flow, dividing fabrication into frontend-of-the-line (FEOL) and backend-of-the-line (BEOL) modules, highlighting key process steps from wafer preparation through transistor formation to metallization and final passivation.

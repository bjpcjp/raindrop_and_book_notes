This chapter provides an overview of CMOS fabrication, detailing the essential unit processes such as wafer manufacture, thermal oxidation, doping, photolithography, thin-film removal, and deposition techniques, and explains how these are integrated in a typical CMOS process flow divided into frontend-of-the-line (FEOL) and backend-of-the-line (BEOL) modules. It highlights the complexity and interdependence of these processes in forming isolated CMOS transistors, their wiring via multiple metal layers, and concludes with backend processes including wafer probing and final testing to ensure device functionality and yield.

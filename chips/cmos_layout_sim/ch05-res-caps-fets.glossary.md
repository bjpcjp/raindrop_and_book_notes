- **Bottom plate capacitance** — Parasitic capacitance from the bottom plate (usually poly1 or metal) of a capacitor to the substrate.

- **Interdigitated layout** — Layout technique where two resistors are interleaved unit cells to average process gradient variations and improve matching.  
- **Lateral diffusion (Ldiff)** — Lateral spreading of dopants during source/drain implant, reducing effective MOSFET channel length.  
- **Lateral capacitor** — Capacitor implemented using two metal layers and vias, where fringe capacitance is a major component.  
- **Length (L)** — Distance between source and drain in a MOSFET channel; determines device switching characteristics.  
- **Metal-only capacitor** — Capacitor constructed using metal layers instead of polysilicon layers, often with large parasitic bottom plate capacitance.  
- **Mobility (μ)** — Measure of carriers’ ability to move through semiconductor material under an electric field (cm²/V∙s).  
- **Number of squares (NRS, NRD)** — Unitless measure used to calculate parasitic source/drain resistances based on the geometry of extensions from the MOSFET.  
- **Oxide capacitance per unit area (C’ox)** — Capacitance density of the gate oxide or inter-poly oxide, a function of oxide thickness and permittivity.  
- **Oxide encroachment** — Imperfect patterning of active area causing oxide to invade active regions, reducing effective MOSFET width.  
- **Parasitic capacitance** — Unwanted capacitances in devices due to layout or process layers, e.g., bottom plate parasitic in capacitors or source/drain junction capacitances.  
- **Polysilicon resistor** — Resistor formed in polysilicon layer, preferred for precision ratioing due to better matching and lower voltage coefficients compared to diffusion resistors.

- **Power dissipation** — Loss of electrical power in devices, influenced by resistor values and their temperature coefficients.  
- **Resistance temperature coefficient (TCR)** — Rate of change of resistor value with temperature, typically given in ppm/°C.  
- **Resistor voltage coefficient (VCR)** — Change in resistance value as a function of voltage applied, due to depletion layer effects.  
- **Source/drain depletion capacitance (Cj, Cjsw)** — Capacitance of source/drain junctions proportional to area and perimeter, influenced by doping and bias.  
- **Source/drain parasitic resistance** — Series resistance from extensions or diffusion regions of MOSFET source and drain, modeled using sheet resistance and squares.  
- **Temperature coefficient of capacitance (TCC)** — Rate of change of capacitance with temperature, typically a few ppm/°C for poly-poly capacitors.

- **Width-to-length ratio (W/L)** — Design ratio determining the drive strength and current capacity of a MOSFET; used extensively in sizing devices.  
- **Common-centroid layout** — Layout technique placing unit cells symmetrically about a common center to improve matching by averaging process gradients.

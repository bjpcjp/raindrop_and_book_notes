- **Active Area** — The region of the silicon wafer where devices such as transistors are formed and current flows.
- **Capacitance (Cox)** — The ability of a device to store charge, often between two conductive layers separated by an oxide.
- **Common-Centroid Layout** — A method of arranging unit elements symmetrically around a center point to improve matching and reduce gradient effects.
- **Depletion Capacitance** — Capacitance due to the depletion region at a pn junction under reverse bias.
- **Diffusion Capacitance** — Capacitance that appears when a pn junction is forward biased (commonly misused to describe junction capacitance).
- **Drain/Source Depletion Capacitance** — Junction capacitance associated with the MOSFET's drain and source regions.
- **Dummy Elements** — Extra device units added in a layout to minimize edge effects and improve matching.
- **Interdigitated Layout** — A layout technique where unit cells of two devices are alternated to evenly distribute process variations.
- **Lateral Diffusion** — The horizontal spreading of dopants beneath the gate oxide during fabrication, affecting device dimensions.
- **Length (Ldrawn)** — The drawn physical length of a MOSFET channel, often reduced effectively by lateral diffusion.
- **Metal Capacitor** — A capacitor formed by overlapping metal layers used when poly layers are limited.
- **Mobility** — A material parameter describing how easily charge carriers move through a semiconductor.
- **N-Well Resistor** — A resistor formed in the n-well region of a CMOS process, characterized by sheet resistance and temperature/voltage coefficients.
- **Oxide Capacitance per Area (C'ox)** — Capacitance normalized by area between gate poly layers separated by silicon dioxide.
- **Oxide Encroachment** — The undesired extension of oxide into the active area, reducing effective transistor width.
- **Parasitic Capacitance** — Unintended capacitance from device structures to substrate or other terminals.
- **Polysilicon Resistor** — A resistor made from polysilicon, preferred for precision due to better matching and stability.
- **Poly-Poly Capacitor** — Capacitor built using two polysilicon layers separated by oxide, used for precision analog designs.
- **Resistor Temperature Coefficient (TCR)** — A measure of how much a resistor's value changes with temperature.
- **Resistor Voltage Coefficient (VCR)** — A measure of how much a resistor's value changes with applied voltage.
- **Sheet Resistance (Rsh)** — Resistance per square unit of a thin resistive layer, used to calculate resistor values.
- **Source/Drain Series Resistance** — Resistance due to the layout of contacts and diffusion extensions at source/drain terminals.
- **Temperature Coefficient (Temp Co)** — Rate at which a device parameter changes with temperature, expressed in ppm/°C.
- **Unit Cell (Resistor)** — A basic resistor layout block used repetitively to form larger resistors while improving matching.
- **Voltage Coefficient (VCC) of Capacitor** — The change of capacitor value with applied voltage.
- **Width (W)** — The physical width of a MOSFET channel or resistor, affecting current and resistance.
- **Winding (Snake) Layout** — Layout technique to create long channels by serpentine patterning of active areas under the gate poly.

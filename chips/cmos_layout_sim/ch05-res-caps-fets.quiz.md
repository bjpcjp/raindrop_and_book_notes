1. **Q:** How do temperature and voltage coefficients affect the resistance of an n-well resistor, and how can their impact be quantified for precision circuit design?
   **A:** The resistance of an n-well resistor increases with temperature, characterized by a positive temperature coefficient of resistance (TCR₁), which typically ranges around 2400 ppm/°C for n-well resistors. This change can be modeled linearly as R(T) = R(T₀)·(1 + TCR₁·(T - T₀)), where T₀ is the reference temperature. The voltage coefficient of resistance (VCR₁), often about 8000 ppm/V, accounts for resistance changes due to voltage and is modeled as R(V) = R(V₀)·(1 + VCR₁·(V - V₀) + VCR₂·(V - V₀)²). While temperature often dominates resistance variation, voltage dependence can more significantly affect circuit performance, especially in voltage dividers where temperature effects cancel but voltage-dependent mismatches do not.

2. **Q:** Explain the advantages of unit resistor cells, interdigitated, and common-centroid layouts in minimizing the effects of process gradients and improving matching in precision integrated resistors.
   **A:** Unit resistor cells use identical layout units to implement larger resistor values by paralleling or series connecting them, reducing mismatch errors due to processing variations. Interdigitated layouts alternate unit cells of different resistors to distribute linear process gradients evenly, improving matching by averaging spatial variations. Common-centroid layouts arrange unit cells symmetrically around a common center, further canceling linear gradients by balancing spatial variations, offering better matching than interdigitated layouts despite uneven parasitics. Dummy elements can also be used to equalize edge effects, ensuring similar doping diffusion profiles and further enhancing matching.

3. **Q:** Describe the structure and temperature and voltage dependencies of poly-poly capacitors in CMOS processes, including typical values for oxide thickness and capacitance per unit area.
   **A:** Poly-poly capacitors are formed by overlapping two polysilicon layers separated by silicon dioxide dielectric of thickness comparable to gate oxide (~14-200 Å). Capacitance is given by C = C’_ox · A, where C’_ox = ε_ox / t_ox is the oxide capacitance per unit area (e.g., 1.75 fF/μm² for 200 Å oxide and 25 fF/μm² for 14 Å oxide). The temperature coefficient of capacitance (TCC) is approximately 20 ppm/°C, indicating a slight increase with temperature. The voltage coefficient of capacitance (VCC) is about 10 ppm/V, representing small capacitance variation with applied voltage. Bottom plate parasitic capacitance (polyl to substrate) can be 20% or more of the intended capacitance and must be considered in precision designs.

4. **Q:** What are the implications of lateral diffusion and oxide encroachment on the effective MOSFET channel length and width, and how are these accounted for in layout and device modeling?
   **A:** Lateral diffusion of the implanted source/drain regions under the gate reduces the effective channel length from the drawn length, modeled as L_effective = L_drawn - 2·L_diffuse. Oxide encroachment occurs when oxide masks extend into the active area, reducing the MOSFET’s effective width by 2·W_encroach. To compensate, layouts usually "bloat" the active areas, and SPICE or process models adjust device parameters accordingly. The lightly doped drain (LDD) structure uses spacers to reduce lateral diffusion. These effects influence threshold voltage, capacitances, and channel resistance, thus impacting device electrical characteristics.

5. **Q:** How are source/drain parasitic capacitances and resistances modeled in MOSFET devices, and what layout considerations influence their magnitudes?
   **A:** Source and drain parasitic capacitances consist of junction bottom capacitance (modeled via area, C_j, and grading coefficients) and sidewall capacitance (modeled via perimeter, C_jsw). These capacitances depend on doping profiles and bias voltages as per SPICE parameters (cj, cjsw, pb, pbsw, mj, mjsw). Parasitic resistances arise from extensions between contacts and the channel and are modeled as sheet resistance times the number of squares (Rs = NRS·Rsh, Rd = NRD·Rsh). Layouts spreading contacts to metal pads and minimizing active region lengths between contact and channel help reduce these parasitics. The number of squares is estimated by dimensions of source/drain extension regions relative to the device width.

6. **Q:** Describe the layout techniques used to implement long-length and large-width MOSFETs and explain the impact of these techniques on device electrical properties such as switching resistance and parasitic capacitance.
   **A:** Long-length MOSFETs are laid out by "snaking" the active area back and forth beneath the poly gate to increase effective channel length while maintaining compact area. Large-width MOSFETs are constructed by placing multiple poly "fingers" in parallel over active regions, sharing source/drain diffusion to minimize area and parasitic resistance. These multi-finger devices have a total effective width equal to the sum of finger widths and an effective length given by poly gate length. The layout affects series resistance and parasitic capacitance distribution; for instance, uneven active area sides in even-finger devices cause asymmetrical drain/source capacitances, influencing device switching performance and requiring careful terminal assignment in circuit design.
   **External example:** The MOSIS layout guidelines discuss multi-finger transistor design for optimizing area versus performance trade-offs. https://www.mosis.com/layout/man-chap3.pdf

7. **Q:** What design considerations and layout techniques are crucial when implementing precision resistor strings, such as R-2R ladder networks, to minimize errors from process gradients, conductivity modulation, and parasitic effects?
   **A:** To minimize process gradient effects on resistor matching, common-centroid layouts and two-string averaging topologies are employed, which symmetrically distribute process variations to cancel mismatches. Large resistor widths and lengths (≥10× minimum feature size width and ≥100× length) ensure better matching and reduced self-heating. Conductivity modulation, caused by metal layer potentials overlaying resistors, is mitigated by avoiding metal over resistors, routing signals on higher metal layers with adequate vias, or inserting grounded metal shields between resistor and metal routing. Contacts are numerous to reduce contact resistance. Resistor layout also uses dummy elements to balance edge diffusion effects.

- **Acquisition time** — Time required for the sample-and-hold (S/H) circuit to track the input signal within a specified tolerance during sampling mode.  
- **Aperture error (aperture uncertainty/jitter)** — Transient error caused by the finite time needed to disconnect the sampling capacitor from the input, causing variations in the sampled value.

- **Analog-to-digital converter (ADC)** — Device that converts continuous analog signals into discrete digital representations.  
- **Bias error** — (Not explicitly defined, similar to offset) An error shifting the output away from the expected zero or ideal reference level.  
- **Charge injection** — Charge transferred from the channel of a switch onto the sample-and-hold capacitor, causing pedestal error.  
- **Differential nonlinearity (DNL)** — Deviation between the actual step size and the ideal step size in a DAC or ADC, measured in least significant bits (LSBs).  
- **Digital-to-analog converter (DAC)** — Device that converts digital signals into continuous analog voltages or currents.  
- **Dispersion (not explicitly named, related to INL/DNL)** — Variations in output linearity or uniformity in data converters.  
- **Dynamic range (DR)** — Ratio of the largest to smallest output signal in a data converter, typically expressed in decibels (dB).  
- **Effective number of bits (ENOB)** — Number of bits of resolution in a data converter approximated from its signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).  
- **Full-scale voltage (VFS)** — Maximum analog output voltage a DAC can produce, typically (2^N - 1)/2^N times the reference voltage.  
- **Gain error (scale factor error)** — Difference in slope between actual and ideal transfer characteristics of a DAC or ADC.  
- **Hold mode** — Period in sample-and-hold operation when the sampled value is held constant for conversion.  
- **Integral nonlinearity (INL)** — Cumulative deviation of the output values or code transitions from a straight reference line in a data converter.  
- **Latency** — Total delay between a change in digital input and when the analog output settles within tolerance in a DAC.  
- **Least significant bit (LSB)** — Smallest change in output voltage corresponding to a 1-bit increment in digital input.  
- **Missing codes** — Digital output codes of an ADC that never appear at the output due to non-monotonic behavior or large negative DNL.  
- **Monotonicity** — Property of a data converter where output analog levels never decrease as digital input codes increase.  
- **Nyquist Criterion** — The sampling rate must be at least twice the highest frequency component of the analog signal to avoid aliasing.  
- **Offset error** — Constant voltage offset from zero output in a DAC or deviation in the first code transition of an ADC.  
- **Overshoot** — Transient excursion beyond the final value in a sample-and-hold circuit during acquisition.  
- **Pedestal error** — Voltage error caused by charge injection and clock feedthrough in a sample-and-hold circuit during hold mode.  
- **Quantization error** — Error resulting from approximating a continuous analog input signal to the nearest digital value during conversion.  
- **Resolution** — Number of unique output levels (2^N) a data converter can produce, or smallest voltage change it can resolve.  
- **Sample-and-hold (S/H) circuit** — Circuit that samples an analog input and holds the voltage constant for conversion.  
- **Slew rate limitation** — Maximum rate of change of voltage output of an amplifier limiting the acquisition speed of an S/H circuit.  
- **Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)** — Ratio of the signal power to noise power at the output of a data converter, expressed in decibels.  
- **Sampling frequency (fsampling)** — Rate at which the continuous analog signal is sampled for conversion.  
- **Track-and-hold (T/H) circuit** — Variant of S/H that continuously tracks the input signal during acquisition before holding it.  
- **VLSI floorplanning** — Strategy to physically organize analog and digital blocks on a chip to minimize noise coupling.  
- **Worst-case DNL/INL** — Maximum absolute value of differential or integral nonlinearities defining the worst deviation in a data converter.

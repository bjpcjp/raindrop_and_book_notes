This chapter provides a fundamental understanding of CMOS integrated circuit layout and design, focusing on the n-well as the first fabricated layer, its patterning, parasitic effects such as the n-well/substrate diode, and the associated resistance and capacitance that influence circuit performance. It also covers key concepts including design rules, RC delay through the n-well, diode physics, and SPICE modeling essential for analyzing and simulating CMOS processes.

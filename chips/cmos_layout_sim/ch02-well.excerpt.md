The chapter provides a detailed study of the n-well in CMOS integrated circuit fabrication, including its formation, layout design rules, and electrical characteristics such as resistance, parasitic diodes, and associated capacitances. It also covers modeling and simulation of diode behavior, RC delay through the n-well, and differences in CMOS processes (n-well, p-well, twin-well) with respect to doping and device performance.

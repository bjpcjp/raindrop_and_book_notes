This chapter develops a digital model for the MOSFET, treating NMOS and PMOS devices as logic-controlled switches with effective switching resistances and incorporating capacitive effects to estimate switching delays and transition times in CMOS digital circuits. It also discusses the operation and delay characteristics of pass gates and transmission gates, providing hand-calculation methods and simulation comparisons for both long- and short-channel CMOS processes.

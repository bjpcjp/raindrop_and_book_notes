This chapter develops a digital model for the MOSFET, treating NMOS and PMOS devices as logic-controlled switches to analyze digital circuits and introduces the concept of effective switching resistance and capacitances, including the Miller effect. It further explores the behavior and delays associated with MOSFET pass gates, transmission gates, and series connections, providing practical hand-calculation methods alongside simulation comparisons for long- and short-channel CMOS processes.

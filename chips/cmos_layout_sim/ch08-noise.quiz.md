1. **Q:** Explain the three primary types of electrical noise discussed in this overview, and describe why the chapter focuses on inherent circuit noise over the others.
   **A:** The three primary types of electrical noise are: (1) inherent circuit noise resulting from discrete and random movement of charge (e.g., thermal noise, shot noise, flicker noise), (2) quantization noise arising from finite digital word size during analog-to-digital conversion, and (3) coupled noise caused by signals from adjacent circuits interfering with each other. The chapter focuses on inherent noise because it fundamentally limits system performance, is present even before digital conversion, and is prevalent in analog CMOS circuits. Quantization and coupled noise are handled in later chapters.

2. **Q:** How is the root-mean-square (RMS) voltage of a sinusoidal signal related to its peak voltage, and why is it significant in noise analysis?
   **A:** The RMS voltage of a sinewave is equal to its peak voltage divided by the square root of two, \(V_{RMS} = \frac{V_p}{\sqrt{2}}\). This RMS value is significant because it represents the equivalent DC voltage that would dissipate the same power in a resistor and is the appropriate parameter for summing mean-squared voltages (powers) when analyzing noise signals, rather than summing RMS voltages directly.

3. **Q:** Describe the method by which a spectrum analyzer (SA) measures power spectral density (PSD) and explain the importance of resolution bandwidth (f_res) in interpreting noise spectra.
   **A:** A spectrum analyzer multiplies the input signal by a sinusoid of varying frequency (local oscillator), then passes this through a bandpass filter with bandwidth equal to the resolution bandwidth (f_res). The filtered output's power is measured point-by-point across frequencies. PSD is obtained by dividing the measured power by f_res; for continuous spectra, PSD remains constant as resolution bandwidth varies, but for discrete tones (sinewaves), PSD amplitude scales inversely with f_res. This distinction is vital in properly interpreting PSD plots and noise measurements.

4. **Q:** Derive the expression for root-mean-square (RMS) noise voltage from a flat (white) noise PSD over a finite bandwidth, and explain the concept of noise-equivalent bandwidth (NEB) for circuits with frequency roll-off.
   **A:** For white noise with PSD \(V^{2}_{noise}(f) = V^2_{flat}\), RMS noise voltage over bandwidth B is \(V_{RMS} = \sqrt{V^2_{flat} \cdot B}\). For circuits with frequency-dependent roll-off modeled as a single-pole filter (bandwidth \(f_{3dB}\)), NEB is \(NEB = \frac{\pi}{2}f_{3dB}\), and the RMS noise voltage is \(V_{RMS} = V_{LF,noise} \sqrt{NEB}\), where \(V_{LF,noise}\) is the low-frequency noise PSD. NEB effectively accounts for the reduced noise bandwidth due to the filter roll-off.

5. **Q:** What is input-referred noise, how is it calculated for an amplifier, and why is it useful despite not physically existing at the input node?
   **A:** Input-referred noise is the equivalent noise voltage or current source placed at the input of an amplifier that would produce the measured output noise if the amplifier were noiseless. It is calculated by dividing the output noise PSD by the square of the amplifier gain (for voltage noise). It is useful for comparing the noise levels of different circuits on a common basis and determining how circuit design elements affect noise performance, even though the actual noise sources often exist inside the amplifier.

6. **Q:** Summarize the key difference between thermal noise and shot noise, including the conditions under which each appears and their PSD expressions.
   **A:** Thermal noise arises from thermal agitation of carriers in any conductor or resistor, existing even at zero current, with a white PSD \(V^2_R = 4kTR\) (units V²/Hz). Shot noise is due to discrete charge carriers crossing a potential barrier (e.g., a diode junction) under bias with current flow, with PSD \(I^2_{shot} = 2qI_{DC}\) (units A²/Hz). Thermal noise is independent of current flow; shot noise requires a bias current and is linked to the quantized nature of charge flow.

7. **Q:** Describe flicker noise including its PSD behavior, typical frequency dependence, and its implications on long signal integration or averaging times.
   **A:** Flicker noise, or 1/f noise, is a low-frequency noise source with PSD inversely proportional to frequency, modeled as \(V^2_{flicker}(f) = \frac{F_{NN}}{f}\), and is dominant at low frequencies. Unlike white noise, its RMS noise increases with longer measurement times or averaging periods because integrating 1/f noise leads to RMS voltage proportional to the logarithm of the frequency ratio or linearly with measurement time. Thus, increasing averaging time does not necessarily improve SNR for signals dominated by flicker noise.
   **External example:** IEEE authors explain flicker noise and its consequences in electronics: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6967985

8. **Q:** Explain how noise figure (NF) is defined and calculated for an amplifier, the role of source resistance, and why an infinite or zero source resistance leads to meaningless NF.
   **A:** NF quantifies the degradation of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) by an amplifier: \(NF = 10 \log\frac{SNR_{in}}{SNR_{out}}\). It can be computed as the ratio of total output noise power to the output noise power due to source resistance noise multiplied by gain squared. When source resistance \(R_s\) is zero (ideal voltage source) or infinite (ideal current source), input SNR approaches infinity or zero, rendering NF undefined or meaningless, since NF assumes a finite source impedance producing thermal noise referenced at input.

9. **Q:** Discuss the role of correlation between noise sources in noise analysis and why assuming zero correlation is common, including the mathematical implication for output power.
   **A:** Correlation between noise sources affects the total power delivered to a load; if sources are correlated, cross terms in power calculation can either increase or decrease total power, invalidating simple sum-of-powers assumptions. Zero correlation implies cross terms average to zero, allowing RMS powers to be summed directly. Non-zero correlation can lead to constructive or destructive interference, changing dissipated power beyond the sum of individual noise powers. Hence, zero correlation is assumed to simplify noise analysis in typical circuits.

10. **Q:** How does feedback affect noise in an amplifier system, and what is the general formula for output noise including feedback gain?
    **A:** Feedback does not inherently reduce the input-referred noise; the output noise voltage including input-referred noise is given by \(V_{out} = \frac{A}{1 + \beta A}(V_{in} + V_{noise,in})\), where A is amplifier gain and \(\beta\) the feedback factor. The input-referred noise adds directly to the input signal and is attenuated by the loop gain \(1+\beta A\) at the output, implying feedback shapes gain but does not eliminate inherent noise sources.

This chapter develops feedback amplifier theory, focusing on negative feedback to stabilize and improve amplifier performance by desensitizing gain, extending bandwidth, reducing distortion, and controlling input/output impedances across four feedback topologies: series-shunt, shunt-shunt, series-series, and shunt-series. It details methods for analyzing open- and closed-loop parameters, recognizes feedback configurations in transistor-level circuits, and addresses stability criteria using loop gain, phase margin, and return ratio, with examples demonstrating practical CMOS feedback amplifier designs.

This chapter develops feedback amplifier theory, focusing on negative feedback configurations—series-shunt, shunt-shunt, series-series, and shunt-series—and their effects on gain stability, bandwidth extension, distortion reduction, and input/output impedance control. It details methods for analyzing and designing such amplifiers, including determining open- and closed-loop gains, feedback factor, loading effects, and stability criteria, with practical CMOS circuit examples and emphasis on maintaining system stability through phase and gain margin considerations.

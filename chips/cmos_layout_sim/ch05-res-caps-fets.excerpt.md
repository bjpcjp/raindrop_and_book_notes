This chapter discusses the layout and temperature/voltage dependence of resistors, capacitors, and MOSFETs in CMOS processes, emphasizing precision techniques such as unit cells, common-centroid layouts, and guard rings to improve matching and reduce parasitics. It also covers the use of poly2 for poly-poly capacitors, the effect of lateral diffusion and oxide encroachment on MOSFET dimensions, and strategies for minimizing parasitic capacitances and resistances in device layouts.

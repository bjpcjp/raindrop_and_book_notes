This chapter discusses the layout techniques and temperature and voltage dependencies of resistors, capacitors, and MOSFETs in CMOS processes, focusing on precision methods such as unit cells, common-centroid layout, and interdigitated structures to improve matching. It also covers the fabrication and parasitics of poly-poly capacitors, the impact of lateral diffusion and oxide encroachment in MOSFETs, and methods for minimizing parasitic capacitances and resistances to optimize circuit performance.

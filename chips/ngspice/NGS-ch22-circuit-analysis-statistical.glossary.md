- **AGAUSS** — A function providing Gaussian-distributed random variation with absolute standard deviation for parameters.  
- **alter** — ngspice command to change device or model parameter values during scripting or repeated simulations.  
- **altermod** — ngspice command to modify device model parameters within a simulation script or loop.  
- **Behavioral sources** — Sources (B, E, G, R, L, C) in ngspice that can model controlled voltages or currents, including those with statistical or random control.  
- **Control voltage (TRRANDOM)** — A voltage source option in ngspice that generates random voltage sequences controlling devices during transient simulations.  
- **Gaussian distribution** — A probability distribution characterized by a bell curve, with mean (µ) and standard deviation (σ), used for statistical parameter variation.  
- **Gnuplot** — A plotting tool used to analyze and visualize statistical data generated by ngspice simulations, including curve fitting.  
- **Monte-Carlo simulation** — A statistical method involving repeated circuit simulations with randomly varied parameters to evaluate performance spread and reliability.  
- **ngspice scripting language** — The built-in scripting framework in ngspice for automating simulations, parameter variation, loops, and data processing.  
- **param (.param command)** — An ngspice command defining parameters that can include random or statistical functions evaluated at simulation start.  
- **Random number generator** — The mechanism used by ngspice to produce pseudo-random numbers, seedable for reproducibility.  
- **sgauss()** — A scripting function returning Gaussian distributed random numbers with zero mean and unit standard deviation in ngspice.  
- **sunif()** — A scripting function returning uniformly distributed random numbers in the interval [-1, 1) in ngspice.  
- **TRRANDOM** — Transient random option for voltage sources in ngspice to apply time-dependent random variations during simulation.  
- **uniform distribution** — A probability distribution where all values within a specified range occur with equal likelihood, used for parameter variation.  
- **Wien bridge oscillator** — A classic oscillator circuit example used to demonstrate statistical variation through controlled behavioral resistors.

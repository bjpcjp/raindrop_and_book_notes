- **.control section** — A block in an input file containing commands for simulation control and data analysis executed interactively or automatically by ngspice.  
- **.lib command** — A command to include external libraries; requires both filename and library name in ngspice, otherwise replaced by .inc.  
- **.plot command** — A directive in the input file to produce ASCII or graphical plots of simulation data.  
- **.print command** — A command specifying output of simulation results as printed values to console or file.  
- **.spiceinit file** — A user or standard configuration script executed at ngspice startup to set aliases, variables, or commands.  
- **ASCII plot** — A textual representation of simulation results displayed in a terminal or console.  
- **Batch mode (-b)** — A non-interactive mode where ngspice reads input files, runs simulations, and outputs results without user interaction.  
- **BSIM3 model** — A transistor device model used in simulations; version 3.3.0 supports OpenMP parallelization in ngspice.  
- **Control mode** — Interactive mode using a control section or file to automate running and analyzing simulations.  
- **Display environment variable** — A variable in Unix-like OSs setting the destination for graphical output via X Window System.  
- **Download repository (Git)** — The source code location for ngspice available via Git for cloning or updating the current development version.  
- **E Source with LAPLACE** — A voltage-controlled source using Laplace transform-based models (XSPICE feature).  
- **Interactive mode (-i)** — Operation mode allowing manual input and command execution within ngspice's console interface.  
- **ngbehavior variable** — A setting controlling compatibility modes in ngspice to emulate different SPICE dialects.  
- **ngnutmeg** — A utility for post-processing and plotting data output generated by ngspice simulations.  
- **OpenMP** — An API for parallel programming used in ngspice to speed up device model calculations on multi-core CPUs.  
- **Rawfile (-r option)** — The simulation results file, which can be in binary or ASCII format, used for storage or later analysis.  
- **Server mode (-s option)** — A mode where ngspice reads from standard input and writes simulation output to standard output for piping with other tools.  
- **Shared library** — A dynamically linked version of ngspice that can be used by other programs; special care needed for relative paths.  
- **Simulation time** — The CPU time required to complete a simulation, influenced by models, optimizations, and processor usage.  
- **spice3f5** — The Berkeley SPICE version from which ngspice is derived, providing core simulation capabilities.  
- **Step command (.step)** — A command for parameter sweeping, often replaced or emulated in ngspice using control section scripting.  
- **SPICE netlist** — A textual description of an electronic circuit used as input for simulation.  
- **SPICE raw data file** — The output data file produced by ngspice containing simulation results in binary or ASCII form.  
- **.step replacement script** — A control section loop used in ngspice to perform parameter sweeps instead of a direct .step command.  
- **X Window System** — A graphical windowing system used on Unix/Linux for displaying ngspice plots.

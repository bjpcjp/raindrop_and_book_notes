 Transmission Lines

Ngspice implements both the original SPICE3f5 transmission lines models and the one introduced with KSPICE. The latter provide an improved transient analysis of lossy transmission lines.
Unlike SPICE models that use the state-based approach to simulate lossy transmission lines,
KSPICE simulates lossy transmission lines and coupled multiconductor line systems using the
recursive convolution method. The impulse response of an arbitrary transfer function can be
determined by deriving a recursive convolution from the Pade approximations of the function.
We use this approach for simulating each transmission line’s characteristics and each multiconductor line’s modal functions. This method of lossy transmission line simulation has been
proved to give a speedup of one to two orders of magnitude over SPICE3f5.

## 6.1 Lossless Transmission Lines

General form:
```
   TXXXXXXX N1 N2 N3 N4 Z0=VALUE <TD=VALUE>
  + <F=FREQ <NL=NRMLEN>> <IC=V1, I1, V2, I2>

```
Examples:
```
  T1 1 0 2 0 Z0=50 TD=10NS
n1 and n2 are the nodes at port 1; n3 and n4 are the nodes at port 2. z0 is the characteristic

```
impedance. The length of the line may be expressed in either of two forms. The transmission
delay, td, may be specified directly (as td=10ns, for example). Alternatively, a frequency f
may be given, together with nl, the normalized electrical length of the transmission line with
respect to the wavelength in the line at the frequency ‘f’. If a frequency is specified but nl is
omitted, 0.25 is assumed (that is, the frequency is assumed to be the quarter-wave frequency).
Note that although both forms for expressing the line length are indicated as optional, one of
the two must be specified.

Note that this element models only one propagating mode. If all four nodes are distinct in the actual circuit, then two modes may be excited. To simulate such a situation, two transmission-line
elements are required. (see the example in Chapt. 21.7 for further clarification.) The (optional)


-----

initial condition specification consists of the voltage and current at each of the transmission line
ports. Note that the initial conditions (if any) apply only if the UIC option is specified on the
```
.TRAN control line.

```
Note that a lossy transmission line (see below) with zero loss may be more accurate than the
lossless transmission line due to implementation details.

## 6.2 Lossy Transmission Lines

General form:
```
   OXXXXXXX n1 n2 n3 n4 mname

```
Examples:
```
   O23 1 0 2 0 LOSSYMOD
   OCONNECT 10 5 20 5 INTERCONNECT

```
This is a two-port convolution model for single conductor lossy transmission lines. n1 and n2
are the nodes at port 1; n3 and n4 are the nodes at port 2. Note that a lossy transmission line
with zero loss may be more accurate than the lossless transmission line due to implementation
details.

### 6.2.1 Lossy Transmission Line Model (LTRA)

The uniform RLC/RC/LC/RG transmission line model (referred to as the LTRA model henceforth) models a uniform constant-parameter distributed transmission line. The RC and LC
cases may also be modeled using the URC and TRA models; however, the newer LTRA model
is usually faster and more accurate than the others. The operation of the LTRA model is based
on the convolution of the transmission line’s impulse responses with its inputs (see [8]). The
LTRA model takes a number of parameters, some of which must be given and some of which
are optional.


-----

|Name|Parameter|Units/Type|Default|Example|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|R|resistance/length|Ω/unit|0.0|0.2|
|L|inductance/length|H/unit|0.0|9.13e-9|
|G|conductance/length|mhos/unit|0.0|0.0|
|C|capacitance/length|F/unit|0.0|3.65e-12|
|LEN|length of line|unit|no default|1.0|
|REL|breakpoint control|arbitrary unit|1|0.5|
|ABS|breakpoint control||1|5|
|NOSTEPLIMIT|don’t limit time-step to less than line delay|flag|not set|set|
|NO CONTROL|don’t do complex time-step control|flag|not set|set|
|LININTERP|use linear interpolation|flag|not set|set|
|MIXEDINTERP|use linear when quadratic seems bad|flag|not set|set|
|COMPACTREL|special reltol for history compaction||RELTOL|1.0e-3|
|COMPACTABS|special abstol for history compaction||ABSTOL|1.0e-9|
|TRUNCNR|use Newton-Raphson method for time-step control|flag|not set|set|
|TRUNCDONTCUT|don’t limit time-step to keep impulse-response errors low|flag|not set|set|


The following types of lines have been implemented so far:

  - RLC (uniform transmission line with series loss only),

  - RC (uniform RC line),

  - LC (lossless transmission line),

  - RG (distributed series resistance and parallel conductance only).

Any other combination will yield erroneous results and should not be tried. The length LEN
of the line must be specified. NOSTEPLIMIT is a flag that will remove the default restriction
of limiting time-steps to less than the line delay in the RLC case. NO CONTROL is a flag that
prevents the default limiting of the time-step based on convolution error criteria in the RLC and
RC cases. This speeds up simulation but may in some cases reduce the accuracy of results.
```
LININTERP is a flag that, when specified, will use linear interpolation instead of the default

```
quadratic interpolation for calculating delayed signals. MIXEDINTERP is a flag that, when specified, uses a metric for judging whether quadratic interpolation is not applicable and if so uses
linear interpolation; otherwise it uses the default quadratic interpolation. TRUNCDONTCUT is a
flag that removes the default cutting of the time-step to limit errors in the actual calculation of
impulse-response related quantities. COMPACTREL and COMPACTABS are quantities that control
the compaction of the past history of values stored for convolution. Larger values of these lower
accuracy but usually increase simulation speed. These are to be used with the TRYTOCOMPACT
option, described in the .OPTIONS section. TRUNCNR is a flag that turns on the use of NewtonRaphson iterations to determine an appropriate time-step in the time-step control routines. The


-----

default is a trial and error procedure by cutting the previous time-step in half. REL and ABS are
quantities that control the setting of breakpoints.

The option most worth experimenting with for increasing the speed of simulation is REL. The
default value of 1 is usually safe from the point of view of accuracy but occasionally increases
computation time. A value greater than 2 eliminates all breakpoints and may be worth trying
depending on the nature of the rest of the circuit, keeping in mind that it might not be safe from
the viewpoint of accuracy.

Breakpoints may usually be entirely eliminated if it is expected the circuit will not display
sharp discontinuities. Values between 0 and 1 are usually not required but may be used for
setting many breakpoints.
```
COMPACTREL may also be experimented with when the option TRYTOCOMPACT is specified in

```
a .OPTIONS card. The legal range is between 0 and 1. Larger values usually decrease the
accuracy of the simulation but in some cases improve speed. If TRYTOCOMPACT is not specified
on a .OPTIONS card, history compaction is not attempted and accuracy is high.
```
NO CONTROL, TRUNCDONTCUT and NOSTEPLIMIT also tend to increase speed at the expense of

```
accuracy.

## 6.3 Uniform Distributed RC Lines

General form:
```
   UXXXXXXX n1 n2 n3 mname l=len <n=lumps>

```
Examples:
```
  U1 1 2 0 URCMOD L=50U
   URC2 1 12 2 UMODL l=1MIL N=6
n1 and n2 are the two element nodes the RC line connects, while n3 is the node the capacitances

```
are connected to. mname is the model name, len is the length of the RC line in meters. lumps,
if specified, is the number of lumped segments to use in modeling the RC line (see the model
description for the action taken if this parameter is omitted).

### 6.3.1 Uniform Distributed RC Model (URC)

The URC model is derived from a model proposed by L. Gertzberg in 1974. The model is
accomplished by a subcircuit type expansion of the URC line into a network of lumped RC
segments with internally generated nodes. The RC segments are in a geometric progression,
increasing toward the middle of the URC line, with K as a proportionality constant. The number of lumped segments used, if not specified for the URC line device, is determined by the
following formula:

2[�]

log _Fmax RL_ _CL_ [2][π][L][2][ ���] [(][K]K[−][1][)]

���

���� ���
_N =_ (6.1)

log _K_


-----

The URC line is made up strictly of resistor and capacitor segments unless the ISPERL parameter is given a nonzero value, in which case the capacitors are replaced with reverse biased diodes
with a zero-bias junction capacitance equivalent to the capacitance replaced, and with a saturation current of ISPERL amps per meter of transmission line and an optional series resistance
equivalent to RSPERL ohms per meter.

FMAX Maximum Frequency of interest _Hz_ 1.0 G 6.5 Meg 
RPERL Resistance per unit length Ω/m 1000 10 
CPERL Capacitance per unit length _F/m_ 10e-15 1 p

RSPERL Diode Resistance per unit length Ω/m 0 - 
## 6.4 KSPICE Lossy Transmission Lines

Unlike SPICE3, which uses the state-based approach to simulate lossy transmission lines,
KSPICE simulates lossy transmission lines and coupled multiconductor line systems using the
recursive convolution method. The impulse response of an arbitrary transfer function can be
determined by deriving a recursive convolution from the Pade approximations of the function.
NGSPICE is using this approach for simulating each transmission line’s characteristics and each
multiconductor line’s modal functions. This method of lossy transmission line simulation has
shown to give a speedup of one to two orders of magnitude over SPICE3E. Please note that the
following two models will support only transient simulation, no ac.

n1 and n2 are the nodes of the two ports. The optional instance parameter len is the length of

```
the line and may be expressed in multiples of [unit]. Typically unit is given in meters. len will
override the model parameter length for the specific instance only.

The TXL model takes a number of parameters:

Name Parameter Units/Type Default Example

R resistance/length Ω/unit 0.0 0.2

L inductance/length _H/unit_ 0.0 9.13e-9

G conductance/length _mhos/unit_ 0.0 0.0

LENGTH length of line _unit_ no default 1.0

Model parameter length must be specified as a multiple of unit. Typically unit is given in [m].
For transient simulation only.

### 6.4.2 Coupled Multiconductor Line (CPL)

The CPL multiconductor line model is in theory similar to the RLGC model, but without frequency dependent loss (neither skin effect nor frequency-dependent dielectric loss). Up to 8
coupled lines are supported in NGSPICE.

General form:
```
   PXXXXXXX NI1 NI2...NIX GND1 NO1 NO2...NOX GND2 mname <LEN=LENGTH >

```
Example:
```
  P1 in1 in2 0 b1 b2 0 PLINE
  .model PLINE CPL length={Len}
  +R=1 0 1
  +L={L11} {L12} {L22}
  +G=0 0 0
  +C={C11} {C12} {C22}
  .param Len=1 Rs=0
  + C11=9.143579E-11 C12=-9.78265E-12 C22=9.143578E-11
  + L11=3.83572E-7 L12=8.26253E-8 L22=3.83572E-7
ni1 ... nix are the nodes at port 1 with gnd1; no1 ... nox are the nodes at port 2 with gnd2.

```
The optional instance parameter len is the length of the line and may be expressed in multiples
of [unit]. Typically unit is given in meters. len will override the model parameter length for
the specific instance only.

elements must be specified, for L and C matrices the lower or upper triangular elements must
specified. The parameter LENGTH is a scalar and is mandatory. For transient simulation only.

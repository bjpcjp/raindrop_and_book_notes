- **adms** — A software tool used to compile Verilog-A compact models into C models compatible with ngspice.  
- **admsXml** — A program within adms that converts Verilog-A device models into ngspice-ready C code.  
- **C99 standard** — A version of the C programming language standard that supports variable declarations beyond the top of a block.  
- **CYGWIN** — A Linux-like environment for Windows used to compile and run Unix-based applications, including admsXml.  
- **EKV** — A MOSFET compact model implemented in Verilog-A, supported by the ngspice-adms interface.  
- **HICUM** — A bipolar transistor compact model available in levels 0 and 2, implemented in Verilog-A for ngspice.  
- **MEXTRAM** — A bipolar transistor compact model implemented in Verilog-A and supported by the ngspice-adms interface.  
- **MSYS** — A minimal system for Windows that provides Unix-like build tools and is used to run admsXml binaries.  
- **MINGW** — A minimalist development environment for native Microsoft Windows, used for compiling admsXml with additional steps.  
- **ngspice** — An open-source circuit simulator that supports integration with Verilog-A device models via admsXml.  
- **PSP** — A MOSFET compact model developed by NXP, implemented in Verilog-A for use with ngspice.  
- **README.adms** — A guideline file within the ngspice source tree explaining setup steps for Verilog-A models.  
- **src\spicelib\devices\adms** — The primary directory in ngspice source where new Verilog-A models are integrated.  
- **Verilog-A** — A hardware description language used to model analog and mixed-signal devices behaviorally.  
- **Verilog-A *.va file** — The source code file for a Verilog-A device model, always using the `.va` extension for ngspice.  
- **Zip file package (adms source)** — A ready-to-use archive containing adms source adapted for ngspice integration.

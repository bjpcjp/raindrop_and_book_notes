- **Array parameter** — A parameter specified as a vector requiring values within brackets [ ], representing multiple elements.  
- **CMextern.h** — A temporary file created during preprocessing used in building the XSPICE simulator executable.  
- **Code Model** — A user-defined or built-in functional block within a SPICE simulation representing specific device behavior.  
- **Code Model Preprocessor (cmpp)** — A tool invoked to process code models and create necessary files before simulation.  
- **Complex number** — A value with real and imaginary parts, enclosed in < >, used in model parameters.  
- **Control array** — An array defining control input values corresponding to frequencies or pulse widths in code models.  
- **Interface Specification File (ifspec.ifs)** — A file describing the ports, parameters, and interface details of a code model.  
- **Model Definition File (.mod)** — A file defining the behavior and parameters of a specific code model.  
- **Numerator coefficient array** — Polynomial coefficients defining the numerator in transfer function models.  
- **Port** — A connection point on a code model where signals or data enter or exit, can be scalar or array.  
- **Port type** — The data format or category of a port, such as analog, digital, or event-driven.  
- **Preprocessor error message** — An error generated during directory creation or code model preprocessing.  
- **Scalar port** — A single, non-array port connection point on a code model.  
- **Simulator error message** — An error generated by the simulator during the parsing of a SPICE deck or simulation execution.  
- **Static variable** — A variable in a code model interface that retains its value between simulation steps, but cannot be an array.  
- **Subscript** — An index used to reference elements in array-type ports or parameters.  
- **Temporary file** — A file created during preprocessing or simulation setup that supports building or running the simulation.  
- **Transfer function (s_xfer) model** — A code model representing systems with numerator and denominator polynomial coefficients.  
- **Unterminated comment/string literal** — An error indicating a comment or string in a file was not properly closed or ended.  
- **Vector port** — A port specified as an array requiring subscripts to reference individual elements.  
- **VCO (Voltage Controlled Oscillator)** — A model or block within a code model that generates oscillations based on a control voltage.

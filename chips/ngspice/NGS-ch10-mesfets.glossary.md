- **ALPHA** — Parameter that determines the saturation voltage in the MESFET model.  
- **AREA** — A multiplier for the device to scale its physical size or modeled area.  
- **B** — Doping tail extending parameter affecting the drain current characteristic.  
- **BETA** — Transconductance parameter that controls how drain current varies with gate voltage.  
- **CGD** — Zero-bias gate-to-drain junction capacitance representing charge storage between gate and drain.  
- **CGS** — Zero-bias gate-to-source junction capacitance representing charge storage between gate and source.  
- **FC** — Coefficient used in the forward-bias depletion capacitance formula.  
- **Flicker noise coefficient (KF)** — Parameter defining the intensity of flicker (1/f) noise in the device.  
- **Flicker noise exponent (AF)** — Exponent parameter describing frequency dependence of flicker noise.  
- **IC** — Initial conditions specifying starting voltages for drain-source (VDS) and gate-source (VGS) in simulations.  
- **LAMBDA** — Channel-length modulation parameter that affects output conductance of the MESFET.  
- **MESFET** — Metal-Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistor, a type of transistor used in high-frequency applications.  
- **ND** — Node number representing the drain terminal in the device instance.  
- **NG** — Node number representing the gate terminal in the device instance.  
- **NS** — Node number representing the source terminal in the device instance.  
- **OHMIC RESISTANCES (RD, RS)** — Drain (RD) and source (RS) parasitic resistances modeling contact and access resistance.  
- **PB** — Gate junction potential, a voltage parameter related to the junction capacitance.  
- **Pinch-off Voltage (VTO)** — Threshold voltage at which the conducting channel is pinched off, controlling transistor turn-off.  
- **Statz Model** — MESFET model (level 1) based on GaAs FET characteristics, defining drain current with parameters like VTO, B, BETA, ALPHA, and LAMBDA.  
- **Z (Device Name Prefix)** — The prefix (e.g., Z1) used to identify MESFET device instances in circuit descriptions.

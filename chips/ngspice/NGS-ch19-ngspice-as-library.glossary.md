- **BGThreadRunning** — Callback function indicating if the ngspice background simulation thread is running.  
- **ControlledExit** — Callback function notifying the caller when ngspice requests to exit due to an error or quit command.  
- **GetISRCData** — Callback function to retrieve current source values for EXTERNAL independent current sources during simulation.  
- **GetSyncData** — Callback function used for synchronizing time steps and controlling simulation flow in parallel ngspice instances.  
- **GetVSRCData** — Callback function to retrieve voltage source values for EXTERNAL independent voltage sources during simulation.  
- **ngGet_Vec_Info** — Function returning detailed information and data pointers for a specific simulation output vector.  
- **ngSpice_Command** — Function sending commands to the ngspice shared library for immediate execution.  
- **ngSpice_Circ** — Function sending a full netlist as an array of strings to ngspice for immediate parsing and setup.  
- **ngSpice_CurPlot** — Function returning the name of the current simulation plot.  
- **ngSpice_AllPlots** — Function returning an array of all available plot names from the simulation results.  
- **ngSpice_AllVecs** — Function returning an array of all vector names within a specified plot.  
- **ngSpice_Init** — Function to initialize ngspice shared library with user-defined callback functions before simulation.  
- **ngSpice_Init_Sync** — Extended initialization function enabling callbacks for external source data and synchronization for parallel runs.  
- **ngSpice_SetBkpt** — Function to set breakpoints (specific time points) during transient simulation to control time stepping.  
- **pvector_info** — Pointer to a struct containing metadata and data pointers for a simulation output vector.  
- **SendChar** — Callback function receiving textual output (e.g., stdout or stderr) generated by ngspice.  
- **SendData** — Callback function delivering simulation output values for all vectors at each simulation time step.  
- **SendInitData** — Callback function providing initial vector information when a new plot is generated or simulation starts.  
- **vecinfo** — Structure describing a single simulation output vector, including its name and pointers to its data.  
- **vecinfoall** — Structure containing an array of vecinfo structs representing all vectors in a single simulation plot.  
- **vecvalues** — Structure holding actual data values (real or complex) for a simulation vector at a time point.  
- **vecvaluesall** — Structure containing an array of vecvalues structs for all vectors at a specific simulation time point.  
- **Shared library** — A compiled ngspice module that can be loaded dynamically or linked for embedding ngspice into other applications.  
- **Background thread** — A separate execution thread running the ngspice simulation asynchronously, allowing the caller to remain responsive.  
- **Breakpoints** — Specific simulation times set to control time stepping and enable synchronization or parameter adjustments.  
- **Callback functions** — User-defined functions passed to ngspice to receive simulation data, status, output, or control signals asynchronously.  
- **Circbyline** — Internal ngspice command to send netlist lines one by one to the parser.  
- **dlopen / LoadLibrary** — System calls used to dynamically load shared libraries during runtime on Linux and Windows respectively.  
- **Interactive commands** — ngspice commands sent at runtime for controlling simulations, excluding graphical commands like plot.

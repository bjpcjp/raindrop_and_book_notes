- **AC Analysis** — Simulation of circuit behavior with alternating current signals at specified frequencies.  
- **Area** — Multiplicative factor defining the size of a device relative to a default reference.  
- **Boundary** — The edge or surface of a simulation domain where specific physical properties or conditions can be set.  
- **Capacitance (C)** — Element of the device admittance matrix representing charge storage, measured in Farads.  
- **Conductance (G)** — Element of the device admittance matrix representing electrical conductance, measured in Siemens (Ω⁻¹).  
- **Doping** — The intentional addition of impurities to semiconductor regions to modify electrical properties.  
- **Domain** — A box-shaped physical region of a device defined by material type and identification number.  
- **Electric Field (E.Field)** — Vector quantity representing the force experienced by a charge in the device, measured in V/cm.  
- **Electrode** — A physical contact region for electrical interfacing with the device terminals.  
- **Element Line** — A line in the input file specifying a device instance, its nodes, and parameters.  
- **Initial Conditions (IC.File)** — A file specifying the starting state of a device for simulation initialization.  
- **Level** — Dimensionality or modeling complexity indicator of numerical device models (e.g., 1D or 2D).  
- **Mesh** — A discrete grid used to spatially resolve the device’s physical simulation domain.  
- **Mobility** — A measure of how easily carriers (electrons or holes) move through a material under an electric field.  
- **Model Card (.MODEL)** — Input section defining numerical device parameters and behaviors.  
- **Numerical Device Model** — A device model that solves semiconductor equations numerically rather than using compact analytic models.  
- **Numerical Element Name Prefixes** — ‘D’ for diodes/two-terminal devices, ‘Q’ for bipolar/three-terminal devices, ‘M’ for MOSFET/four-terminal devices.  
- **Output Card** — Input section controlling printed or saved simulation results, including debugging and solution data.  
- **Parameter Abbreviations** — Shortened unique names for cards or parameters to simplify input.  
- **Physical Models (models card)** — Flags selecting physical effects like bandgap narrowing, recombination, and mobility dependence to include in simulations.  
- **Surface Recombination Velocity (SN, SP)** — Rate at which electrons (SN) or holes (SP) recombine at surfaces or interfaces.  
- **Transverse Field Mobility (TransMob)** — Mobility reduction caused by fields perpendicular to current flow, affecting surface carriers.  
- **Work Function** — Energy needed to remove an electron from an electrode material, relevant for insulating contacts.  
- **Width (W)** — Multiplicative factor to scale device width, affecting simulation geometry.

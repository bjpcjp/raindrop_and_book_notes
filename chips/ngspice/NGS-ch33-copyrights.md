### 33.2.1 ‘Modified’ BSD license

All ‘old’ BSD licenses (of SPICE or CIDER) have been changed to the ‘modified’ BSD license
according to the following publication
[(see ftp://ftp.cs.berkeley.edu/pub/4bsd/README.Impt.License.Change):](ftp://ftp.cs.berkeley.edu/pub/4bsd/README.Impt.License.Change)

To All Licensees, Distributors of Any Version of BSD:

As you know, certain of the Berkeley Software Distribution (‘BSD’) source code files require
that further distributions of products containing all or portions of the software, acknowledge
within their advertising materials that such products contain software developed by UC Berkeley and its contributors.

Specifically, the provision reads:

‘3. All advertising materials mentioning features or use of this software must display the following acknowledgment: This product includes software developed by the University of California, Berkeley and its contributors.’

Effective immediately, licensees and distributors are no longer required to include the acknowledgment within advertising materials. Accordingly, the foregoing paragraph of those BSD
Unix files containing it is hereby deleted in its entirety.

### 33.2.2 XSPICE

[According to http://users.ece.gatech.edu/mrichard/Xspice/ (as of Feb. 2012) the XSPICE source](http://users.ece.gatech.edu/mrichard/Xspice/)
code and documentation have been put into the public domain by the Georgia Institute of
Technology.

### 33.2.3 tclspice, numparam

Both software packages are copyrighted and are released under LGPLv2
[(see http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-2.1.html).](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-2.1.html)

### 33.2.4 Linking to GPLd libraries (e.g. readline, fftw, table.cm):

[The readline manual at http://tiswww.case.edu/php/chet/readline/rltop.html states: Readline is](http://tiswww.case.edu/php/chet/readline/rltop.html)
free software, distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License, version 3. This
means that if you want to use Readline in a program that you release or distribute to anyone, the
program must be free software and have a GPL-compatible license.

[According to http://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html, the modified BSD license, thus](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html)
also the ngspice license, belongs to the family of GPL-Compatible Free Software Licen**ses. Therefore the linking restrictions to readline, which have existed with the old BSD license,**
are no longer in effect.

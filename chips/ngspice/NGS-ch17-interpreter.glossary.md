- **AC Analysis** — Small-signal frequency response simulation over a specified frequency range.  
- **Alias** — A shortcut name for a command or sequence of commands in ngspice.  
- **Alter** — Command to change the value or parameter of a device or model.  
- **Altermod** — Command to modify one or more parameters of a device model.  
- **Breakpoint** — A condition at which simulation stops or pauses during execution.  
- **Compose** — Command to create or initialize a vector from specified values or parameters.  
- **Control Section (.control ... .endc)** — Script block within a netlist for commands executed after circuit parsing.  
- **DC Sweep Analysis** — Simulation of circuit behavior while sweeping one or two DC sources.  
- **FFT** — Fast Fourier transform to convert a time-domain signal into frequency-domain data.  
- **Function (user-defined)** — Custom algebraic expression defined with arguments for convenient reuse.  
- **Interactive Interpreter** — The command line interface of ngspice supporting direct commands and scripting.  
- **Let** — Assign a numerical expression or vector value to a named variable.  
- **Model Parameter** — A setting defining characteristics of a device model in the simulation.  
- **Plot (data)** — A group of simulation output vectors that belong together from one analysis run.  
- **Plot (command)** — Command used to graphically display vectors on screen or via external tools.  
- **Rawfile** — A file storing simulation output data, either in binary or ASCII format.  
- **Reset** — Command to clear interim data and restore circuit state to initial conditions.  
- **Save** — Command that specifies which node voltages or branch currents to retain after simulation.  
- **Scale Vector** — The vector used for the X-axis in plotting, such as time or frequency.  
- **Script** — A file or command sequence that automates interactions with ngspice.  
- **Setplot** — Command to choose or create the active plot for analysis or display.  
- **Show** — Command to list the state or parameters of devices in the current circuit.  
- **Stop Command** — Sets simulation breakpoints based on time or variable conditions.  
- **Transient Analysis (tran)** — Time-domain simulation of circuit response.  
- **Vector** — An array of numerical data points representing simulation results or variables.  
- **Wildcard** — A special character or pattern that matches multiple plots or vectors.

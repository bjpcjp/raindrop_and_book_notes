- **ACMAG** — The magnitude of an independent source during AC small-signal analysis.  
- **ACPHASE** — The phase angle of an independent source during AC small-signal analysis, in degrees.  
- **AM (Amplitude Modulated Source)** — A source whose output amplitude is modulated by a lower frequency signal, defined by amplitude, offset, modulation, carrier frequency, and phase.  
- **CCCS (Current-Controlled Current Source)** — A dependent current source controlled by the current through a voltage source.  
- **CCVS (Current-Controlled Voltage Source)** — A dependent voltage source controlled by the current through a voltage source.  
- **DC/TRAN VALUE** — The DC or transient analysis value of a voltage or current source.  
- **DISTOF1 / DISTOF2** — Keywords specifying distortion input frequencies for measuring nonlinear distortion in a source.  
- **Exponential source** — An independent source that generates a waveform with exponential rise and fall transitions.  
- **FREQ** — Frequency parameter for periodic waveforms, typically in Hz.  
- **Gxxxx (Voltage-Controlled Current Source, VCCS)** — A dependent current source whose output current is proportional to a controlling voltage difference.  
- **N+ / N-** — Positive and negative nodes of a source in a circuit.  
- **NC+ / NC-** — Positive and negative controlling nodes for dependent voltage or current sources.  
- **PER (Period)** — The total time of one full cycle of a periodic waveform, such as a pulse.  
- **PHASE** — Phase shift of a waveform in degrees, used especially with XSPICE extensions.  
- **PULSE source** — An independent source generating a rectangular pulse defined by initial and pulsed voltages, delay, rise/fall times, width, and period.  
- **PWL (Piece-Wise Linear)** — A source defined by linear interpolation between specified time-voltage pairs.  
- **SFFM (Single-Frequency Frequency Modulated Source)** — A source with sinusoidal frequency modulation defined by carrier and signal frequencies and modulation index.  
- **TD (Delay Time)** — Time delay before the transient part of a waveform begins.  
- **Transient Noise Source (TRNOISE)** — An independent source injecting noise with defined Gaussian, 1/f, and random telegraph signal components.  
- **TRRANDOM** — An independent source that produces statistically distributed random voltage values, such as Gaussian or uniform noise.  
- **VCCS (Voltage-Controlled Current Source)** — Another term for Gxxxx source, generating current controlled by a voltage difference.  
- **VCVS (Voltage-Controlled Voltage Source)** — A dependent voltage source whose output voltage is proportional to a controlling voltage difference.  
- **VO** — Offset (DC) value of a sinusoidal or modulated source.  
- **VA** — Amplitude of a sinusoidal or modulated source waveform.  
- **Voltage Source** — An independent source defining a voltage between two nodes, possibly time-dependent and used for excitation or current measurement.  
- **Voltage-controlled sources** — Sources whose output depends linearly on a voltage elsewhere in the circuit, e.g., VCCS and VCVS.  
- **Current-controlled sources** — Sources whose output depends linearly on current elsewhere in the circuit, e.g., CCCS and CCVS.

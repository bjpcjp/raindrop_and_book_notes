- **Code Model Generator** — A tool in XSPICE that helps users create custom simulation models using the C programming language.  
- **Code Model Subsystem** — A part of XSPICE that includes a library of models and tools for adding new models for circuit simulation.  
- **Code Model Library** — A collection of over 40 additional simulation components in XSPICE, such as digital gates and integrators.  
- **Digital Gates** — Logic components found in the XSPICE code model library used for digital circuit simulation.  
- **Event-Driven Simulation** — A simulation method where state changes occur based on discrete events rather than continuous time steps.  
- **Model Primitives** — Basic built-in components in NGSPICE like resistors, capacitors, and transistors.  
- **NGSPICE Core** — The fundamental analog circuit simulator in NGSPICE that uses matrix solution techniques.  
- **Nutmeg User Interface** — The command-line interface used in NGSPICE for simulation commands and outputs.  
- **Shared Libraries** — Compiled code model files loaded at runtime by NGSPICE to extend simulation capabilities.  
- **User-Defined Node** — A feature in XSPICE allowing the simulation of custom data types beyond standard electrical nodes.  
- **User-Defined Code Models** — Custom simulation models written by users in C, integrated into the XSPICE environment.  
- **XSPICE Option** — An add-on to NGSPICE that introduces event-driven simulation and user-defined modeling capabilities.  
- **XSPICE Simulator** — The integrated simulation engine that combines NGSPICE's analog core with event-driven features and user models.  
- **XSPICE Top-Level Diagram** — A schematic illustrating the architecture and components of the NGSPICE system with XSPICE enabled.

- **ADMS** — An experimental model compiler translating Verilog-A compact models into C code for ngspice, with some limitations.  
- **Bison** — A parser generator needed to build ngspice from source, including for XSPICE code models.  
- **CIDER** — A mixed-level numerical device simulator included optionally in ngspice.  
- **CMD files (*.cm)** — Code model files in C used by XSPICE extensions within ngspice.  
- **Configure script** — A GNU build process script used to prepare ngspice for compilation with various options.  
- **Editline** — A BSD library providing command line editing features, alternative to GNU readline.  
- **FFTW-3** — A library for fast and accurate Fast Fourier Transform computations, optionally linked to ngspice.  
- **Flex** — A lexical analyzer generator required for building ngspice, especially for XSPICE code models.  
- **Git** — A version control system used to download and update the latest ngspice source code.  
- **Make** — A build automation tool used to compile and install ngspice from source.  
- **MSYS** — A collection of GNU tools and utilities for Windows used to build ngspice with MinGW.  
- **MinGW** — A minimalist GNU environment for Windows allowing native compilation of ngspice.  
- **MS Visual Studio** — An integrated development environment from Microsoft used to build ngspice on Windows.  
- **NGSPICE** — An open-source mixed-level/mixed-signal electronic circuit simulator.  
- **Object files (*.o)** — Compiled intermediate files generated during the build process before linking the executable.  
- **OpenMP** — A parallel programming model enabling multi-core processing support in ngspice builds.  
- **Shared library** — A dynamically linked library (*.so or *.dll) version of ngspice that can be embedded in other programs.  
- **Source tarball** — A compressed archive file containing a released version of the ngspice source code.  
- **spinit** — The initialization script file read by ngspice at startup.  
- **TCP/IP interface (NDEV)** — An experimental external interface for ngspice to communicate with external device simulators.  
- **X11 headers/libs** — Development files for the X Window System required for building ngspice with graphical support.  
- **XSPICE** — Extensions to ngspice providing mixed-signal simulation and dynamic code model loading.  
- **Xgraph** — An X11-based plotting program optionally built with ngspice for graphical output.

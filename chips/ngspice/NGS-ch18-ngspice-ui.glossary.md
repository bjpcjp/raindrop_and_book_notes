- **BSIM3V3** — A MOSFET transistor model version used for accurate simulation of semiconductor devices.  
- **CMC model test suite** — A testing framework that uses ngspice console mode for automated verification of device models.  
- **Console mode** — A command-line interface for ngspice without graphical input or output capabilities.  
- **Control section** — A block in a SPICE input file that encloses commands for simulation control such as running analyses and plotting.  
- **CygWin** — A Unix-like environment and command-line interface for Windows, supporting X11 graphics for ngspice.  
- **Error handling** — The process by which ngspice detects, reports, and responds to errors during simulation or parsing.  
- **Gnuplot** — An external plotting program used with ngspice to generate graphical outputs like x/y plots.  
- **GUI (Graphical User Interface)** — A user interface offering graphical elements for interacting with ngspice, including plotting and command input.  
- **Hardcopy** — A command in ngspice to produce output plots as files, such as Postscript files, for printing or saving.  
- **Hcopydevtype** — A setting in ngspice that specifies the type of device used for printing or generating hardcopy output.  
- **KiCad** — An open source EDA suite integrating schematic capture and ngspice simulation features for electronic circuit design.  
- **MINGW** — A minimalist development environment for native Microsoft Windows applications that can compile ngspice.  
- **MSEspice** — A graphical front-end to ngspice built with the Free Pascal cross-platform RAD environment MSEide+MSEgui.  
- **MS Windows GUI** — A simple graphical interface for ngspice on Windows, enabled by compiling with the --with-wingui flag.  
- **MS Windows Console** — A non-graphical ngspice interface for Windows useful in scripting and pipe applications.  
- **Ngspice** — An open-source mixed-level/mixed-signal electronic circuit simulator with various user interface options.  
- **Postscript printing** — A feature in ngspice to export simulation plots as Postscript files for high-quality printing.  
- **Plot command** — An interactive ngspice command to graph simulation results on screen or send to external plotting tools.  
- **Strict_errorhandling** — A user-settable variable in ngspice that causes immediate exit on parsing errors for stricter error control.  
- **X11 graphics system** — A graphical windowing system commonly used on Linux and CygWin to display ngspice plots.  
- **XCircuit** — A schematic capture tool that integrates with ngspice for electronic circuit design workflows.  
- **XSPICE** — An extended version of SPICE integrated into ngspice, providing additional simulation features and error messages.

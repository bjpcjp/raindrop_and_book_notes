- **Accelerator** — A hardware block designed to speed up specific computations or tasks within a chip.  
- **ASIC** — Application-Specific Integrated Circuit, a customized chip designed for a particular use.  
- **BGA** — Ball Grid Array, a type of packaging for integrated circuits with solder balls on the underside for mounting.  
- **Cache (L1/L2/L3)** — Small, fast memory levels used to store frequently accessed data on-chip.  
- **Chiplet** — A modular chip component integrated with others to build a complete system.  
- **Compiler** — Software that translates code into optimized machine instructions for a specific architecture.  
- **EBITDA** — Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization; an indicator of operating profitability.  
- **FPGA** — Field-Programmable Gate Array, a chip that can be reprogrammed after manufacturing.  
- **Gross Margin (GM)** — The difference between revenue and cost of goods sold, expressed as a percentage of revenue.  
- **JEDEC** — The global standards organization that sets semiconductor industry standards, including for commercial qualification.  
- **Memory Pruning** — The process of reducing memory size and bandwidth requirements by removing unnecessary data or weights.  
- **NVM** — Non-Volatile Memory, memory that retains data without power.  
- **Pipelines** — Sequential stages of processing in hardware or software to improve throughput.  
- **PDK** — Process Design Kit, the set of files and models used for designing chips for a specific foundry process.  
- **PLATFORM** — Not explicitly defined, but implies the hardware or software environment supporting the product and customers.  
- **Process Node** — The semiconductor manufacturing technology node, indicating feature size (e.g., 45nm).  
- **Product “A”** — Existing special-purpose compute engine currently in production.  
- **Product “A+1”** — Next-generation product under development with a target to improve manufacturing costs and performance.  
- **Product “A+2”** — Future product concept representing a traditional die shrink of earlier designs.  
- **R&D (Research and Development)** — Activities aimed at developing and improving products and technology.  
- **Tapeout** — The final stage in chip design where design data is sent for manufacturing mask making.  
- **TAM (Total Addressable Market)** — The total potential market demand or revenue opportunity for a product or service.  
- **TQFP** — Thin Quad Flat Package, a type of chip packaging with leads on all four sides.  
- **Transistor Budget** — The limitation on the number of transistors that can be integrated on a chip due to technology or cost constraints.  
- **Throughput** — The rate at which a system can process tasks or data.  
- **Tier-1 Customer** — A primary, high-volume customer with significant influence on product demand and design.  
- **Yield** — The percentage of manufactured chips meeting quality specifications out of the total produced.

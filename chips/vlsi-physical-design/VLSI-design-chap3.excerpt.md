Chapter 3 covers the fundamentals of chip planning in VLSI physical design, focusing on floorplanning techniques, representations such as constraint-graph pairs and sequence pairs, and algorithms including floorplan sizing, cluster growth, and optimization methods to minimize area and wirelength. It also addresses related aspects like pin assignment and power-ground routing to ensure efficient chip layout and performance.

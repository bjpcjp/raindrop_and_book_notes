Chapter 4 discusses global and detailed placement in VLSI physical design, focusing on optimization objectives such as total wirelength, cut nets, congestion, and signal delay. It reviews various global placement approaches including partitioning-based min-cut placement, analytic placement with quadratic and force-directed methods, and stochastic algorithms like simulated annealing.

This chapter covers timing closure in VLSI physical design, focusing on optimizing circuit layout and netlist modifications to meet timing constraints such as setup and hold times. Key methods include timing-driven placement and routing, static timing analysis, delay budgeting with the zero-slack algorithm, and physical synthesis techniques like gate sizing, buffering, and netlist restructuring.

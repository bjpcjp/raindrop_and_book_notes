- **Algorithm complexity** — A measure of how the runtime of an algorithm increases with the size of the input, often expressed using big-Oh notation.
- **Circuit design** — The stage in VLSI design where the physical electrical circuits are created based on logic design.
- **Constructive heuristic** — An algorithmic approach that builds a solution step-by-step from an incomplete state until completion.
- **Design rules** — Technology-specific constraints such as minimum width, spacing, and overlap that layouts must follow to ensure manufacturability.
- **Directed acyclic graph (DAG)** — A graph with directed edges containing no cycles, used to model dependency relationships.
- **EDA (Electronic Design Automation)** — Software tools and methodologies used to design, analyze, and manufacture integrated circuits.
- **Electrical constraints** — Requirements ensuring the electrical performance of a design, including timing and capacitance limits.
- **Exhaustive enumeration** — A brute-force method examining every possible solution, often impractical for large problems.
- **Feedthrough cell** — A standard cell design used to route signals through unused spaces between cells.
- **FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array)** — A type of integrated circuit that can be programmed after manufacturing to implement various logic functions.
- **Heuristic algorithm** — A problem-solving method that finds near-optimal solutions in a reasonable time without guaranteeing the absolute best result.
- **Iterative heuristic** — An algorithm that starts from a complete solution and improves it repeatedly until stopping criteria are met.
- **Layout layer** — Different material or structural layers on an IC chip, such as metal, polysilicon, or diffusion layers.
- **Manhattan distance** — A distance metric calculating the total horizontal and vertical distance between two points on a grid.
- **Moore’s Law** — The observation that the number of transistors on integrated circuits doubles approximately every 18 months.
- **Multigraph** — A graph that can have multiple edges connecting the same pair of nodes.
- **Netlist** — A description of the electrical connectivity between components or nodes in a circuit.
- **Physical design** — The process of converting circuit logic into geometric shapes and layers for semiconductor fabrication.
- **Rectilinear Steiner minimum tree (RSMT)** — A shortest network connecting given points, possibly including extra points (Steiner points) for optimization.
- **Runtime complexity** — The theoretical amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of input size.
- **Signal routing** — The process of connecting circuit elements electrically through paths on the layout.
- **Standard cell** — Pre-designed logic gates or functions arranged in rows, used to create ASICs efficiently.
- **Stochastic heuristic** — A heuristic algorithm that uses randomness and may produce different results on separate runs.
- **VLSI design flow** — The sequence of steps from system specification to fabrication in designing very large-scale integrated circuits.

Integrated circuit (IC) design has advanced significantly since the 1960s, driven by exponential growth in transistor density and the necessity of automation through electronic design automation (EDA) tools. These tools employ sophisticated deterministic and stochastic heuristic algorithms to address NP-hard physical design problems, leveraging graph theory and computational geometry to optimize layout and connectivity within design constraints.

Global routing in VLSI physical design involves determining wiring connections between placed cells based on a netlist and technology constraints, optimizing objectives such as minimizing wirelength and timing delays while respecting resource capacities. This process uses graph-based representations of routing regions and applies algorithms like rectilinear Steiner minimum trees and shortest path searches to assign nets to routing resources in a coarse-grained manner before detailed routing.

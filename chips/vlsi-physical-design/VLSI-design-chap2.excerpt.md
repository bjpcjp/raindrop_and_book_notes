This chapter discusses netlist and system partitioning in VLSI physical design, focusing on graph partitioning techniques such as the Kernighan-Lin and Fiduccia-Mattheyses algorithms, which aim to minimize cut costs while balancing partition sizes. It also covers extensions to these algorithms, introduces clustering methods to simplify partitioning, and highlights their application in system partitioning onto multiple FPGAs.

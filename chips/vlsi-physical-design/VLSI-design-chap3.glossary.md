- **Block** — A rectangular module or component to be placed on a chip during floorplanning.  
- **Cluster Growth** — A floorplanning algorithm that iteratively adds blocks, optimizing orientations and linear order to reduce wirelength.  
- **Constraint Graph** — Directed graph representing positional constraints among blocks; includes vertical constraint graph (VCG) and horizontal constraint graph (HCG).  
- **Constraint-Graph Pair** — A floorplan representation consisting of both vertical and horizontal constraint graphs to capture block positioning relations.  
- **Corner Points** — Key positions in a shape function representing feasible width-height combinations of a block or floorplan.  
- **DRC (Design Rule Check)** — Verification process ensuring layout complies with manufacturing constraints.  
- **ERC (Electrical Rule Check)** — Verification process checking electrical correctness of a circuit layout.  
- **Floorplan** — The arrangement of blocks within a chip area, defining their sizes and relative positions.  
- **Floorplan Sizing** — Determining the shapes and dimensions of blocks in a floorplan to minimize area or satisfy constraints.  
- **Floorplan Tree (Slicing Tree)** — A binary tree representation of a slicing floorplan, where internal nodes represent cuts and leaves represent blocks.  
- **Global Bounding Box** — The smallest axis-aligned rectangle that contains all blocks in a floorplan.  
- **HCG (Horizontal Constraint Graph)** — A directed graph indicating left-to-right relationships among blocks in a floorplan.  
- **I/O Pads** — Input/output interface blocks placed on the chip perimeter for external connections.  
- **LCS (Longest Common Subsequence)** — A sequence-based algorithm used to compute block coordinates from sequence pairs.  
- **Module** — Synonymous with block; a functional design entity to be placed in floorplanning.  
- **Non-Slicing Floorplan** — A floorplan type that cannot be represented by repeated vertical/horizontal cuts; more general than slicing floorplans.  
- **Placement** — The step in physical design where blocks and standard cells are positioned on the chip.  
- **Pin Assignment** — The process of allocating locations for block pins to optimize routing and signal integrity.  
- **Polish Expression** — A postfix notation representing slicing floorplans for compact expression of cuts and blocks.  
- **Power-Ground Distribution Network** — Layout structure ensuring stable power and ground supply throughout the chip.  
- **Signal Routing** — Connecting block pins with wiring to establish signal paths on the chip.  
- **Simulated Annealing** — A probabilistic optimization technique used in floorplanning to explore design space and minimize cost functions.  
- **Slicing Floorplan** — A floorplan generated by recursively partitioning a rectangle with horizontal or vertical cuts.  
- **Size Function (Shape Function)** — A representation of all legal width-height combinations of a block or floorplan considering constraints.  
- **Sequence Pair** — A floorplan representation using two permutations of blocks describing their relative horizontal and vertical positions.  
- **Source/Sink Nodes** — Artificial nodes added in constraint graphs to denote start and end points for longest path computations.  
- **Static Timing Analysis** — A method to evaluate signal delays on the critical paths through the chip layout.  
- **VDD / GND** — Power supply and ground voltage reference nets distributed through the chip.  
- **VCG (Vertical Constraint Graph)** — A directed graph indicating below-above relationships among blocks in a floorplan.  
- **Wirelength** — The total length of interconnections between blocks, affecting delay and area.

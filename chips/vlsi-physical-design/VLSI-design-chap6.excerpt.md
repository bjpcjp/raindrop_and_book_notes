Detailed routing assigns signal net segments to specific tracks, vias, and metal layers within routing regions like channels and switchboxes, ensuring consistency with global routes while accounting for manufacturing rules and timing. Techniques such as horizontal and vertical constraint graphs, left-edge algorithms, and dogleg routing help optimize track assignment and resolve conflicts in detailed routing processes.

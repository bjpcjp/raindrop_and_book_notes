1. **Q:** What are the definitions, purposes, and key calculation components of EBITDA versus Net Income versus Free Cash Flow, and how do these metrics differ in their applicability and typical advantages or disadvantages?  
   **A:** EBITDA measures operational profitability excluding financing, tax, and non-cash impacts, calculated as Net Income plus depreciation, amortization, interest, and tax; useful for comparing companies within industries irrespective of capital structure but can be overly optimistic and not GAAP-standard. Net Income is total profit after all expenses deducted, including taxes and interest, showing overall profitability and purity of earnings; calculation is revenues minus total expenses; it incorporates all costs but can be distorted by one-offs and financing differences. Free Cash Flow is cash generated after operating costs and capital expenditures, calculated as Net Income plus non-cash items less capital expenditures and changes in net working capital; critical for assessing liquidity and cash available for reinvestment or payments but sensitive to capex decisions and requires detailed cash flow understanding.  
   **External example:** EBITDA is widely used to evaluate operational profitability ignoring financing differences as seen in financial reports of companies like Amazon where EBITDA excludes large depreciation impacting net income. Source: https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/ebitda.asp

2. **Q:** How does DuPont Analysis break down Return on Equity (ROE) and what are its key components, strengths, and limitations?  
   **A:** DuPont Analysis decomposes ROE into three components: net profit margin (operating efficiency), asset turnover (asset utilization), and equity multiplier (financial leverage). This enables detailed understanding of what drives ROE—profitability, efficiency, or leverage. Strengths include pinpointing underlying factors of ROE variance, aiding investor decisions. Limitations are overemphasis on ROE without full financial health context, reliance on historical data, industry-specific capital structure relevance, and ignoring market conditions.

3. **Q:** What roles do Free Cash Flow (FCF) ratios play in financial analysis, what do FCF rate and FCF realization measure, and why is FCF considered the “winner” among profitability and cash metrics?  
   **A:** FCF ratios measure liquidity and financial flexibility, with FCF rate indicating percentage of sales available for investments or payments post operating expenses and capex, and FCF realization showing how efficiently profit converts to cash. FCF is the “winner” because it reflects actual cash a company can deploy, not just accounting profits, critically informing debt management, dividend capacity, and reinvestment capability. Its direct connection to cash flow provides deeper insight than accrual-based profitability metrics.  
   **External example:** Apple’s strong Free Cash Flow rate supports its dividend payments and share buybacks, illustrating its liquidity and cash generation strength. Source: https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/freecashflow.asp

4. **Q:** How should one analyze and forecast the relationship between net income and free cash flow using key working capital components, and why is this important?  
   **A:** Analysis and forecasting involve calculating the ratio of net income to free cash flow for current assets, receivables, cash equivalents, inventory, short-term investments, prepaid expenses, and other current assets to assess if net income is a reliable indicator of cash generation in these areas. Tracking changes over time helps identify management’s efficiency in converting profits to cash, liquidity risks, or operational inefficiencies. This ensures forecasts reflect realistic cash flows rather than purely accounting profits.  
   **External example:** Investment analysts assess quarterly changes in Apple’s receivables and inventory relative to net income to forecast cash flows and liquidity. Source: https://www.cfainstitute.org/en/research/cfa-digest/2015/05/cash-flow-analysis-in-valuation

5. **Q:** In comparing Coca-Cola and PepsiCo using the provided financial analysis, what are the main differences in their profitability, liquidity, efficiency, and capital structure metrics?  
   **A:** Coca-Cola is more profitable with higher gross profit and net profit margins, and a better free cash flow rate, implying superior cash management. Both firms have negative net working capital, financed via high trade payables, but Pepsi shows lower current ratio (<1), which is a liquidity concern. Pepsi is more efficient with better inventory management (lower Days Inventory Outstanding), while Coca-Cola has higher Days Payable Outstanding, indicating better supplier payment terms without harming gross profits. In capital structure, Coca-Cola has higher equity ratio and lower debt ratio than Pepsi, reflecting more conservative leverage.  
   **External example:** Industry comparisons like Coca-Cola’s stronger liquidity ratios compared to PepsiCo are cited in financial analysis reports such as Morningstar’s company comparisons.

6. **Q:** Describe how financial ratios such as ROE, ROCE, and ROA are calculated and interpreted, their best-use scenarios, and differences in applicability across industries.  
   **A:** ROE is net income divided by shareholder equity, measuring returns to equity investors, best for companies heavily equity-financed like services or IT sectors. ROCE (return on capital employed) is net income divided by equity plus long-term debt, measuring profitability on all capital (debt and equity), suited for capital-intensive industries like manufacturing. ROA is net income divided by total assets, indicating asset-use efficiency, useful for cross-industry comparisons. Each reflects different aspects of profitability reliant on company financing and asset structure, requiring industry-context interpretation.  
   **External example:** ROIC and ROA are used in utilities and manufacturing sectors to evaluate capital efficiency because they rely more on fixed assets than equity intensity. Source: https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/finance/return-on-assets-roa/

7. **Q:** What are the implications of capital structure, goodwill, and intangible assets on financial statement analysis, particularly regarding impairment risks and valuation?  
   **A:** Intangible assets and goodwill can represent a significant proportion of total assets, as in Coca-Cola and PepsiCo where goodwill forms nearly 50% of assets, necessitating careful impairment testing to avoid overstated asset values. High amounts of goodwill require analysts to scrutinize impairment losses which can materially impact profitability and solvency ratios. Capital structure affects how debt and equity influence leverage ratios and financial risk. Understanding these effects is critical for accurate valuation and risk assessment.  
   **External example:** The impairment of goodwill famously affected the valuation and earnings of Kraft Heinz, leading to a major write-down in 2019. Source: https://www.investopedia.com/news/kraft-heinz-takes-monumental-15-billion-impairment-charge/

8. **Q:** How does horizontal and vertical financial analysis facilitate understanding of trends and structural composition of financial statements over multiple periods?  
   **A:** Horizontal analysis compares line items over multiple periods to identify growth trends or declines in revenues, expenses, and profit margins, revealing operational and financial progress or problems. Vertical analysis expresses line items as a percentage of total revenue or assets, highlighting cost structure and efficiency at a point in time. Together, they provide complementary views to assess not just absolute changes but proportional relationships crucial for budgeting, forecasting, and benchmarking against peers or industry standards.  
   **External example:** Analysts use horizontal and vertical analysis to track quarterly earnings trends and cost management at companies like Microsoft as part of financial statement review. Source: https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/horizontalanalysis.asp

9. **Q:** Explain the purpose and methodology of price volume mix, segment, and customer analyses in sales performance evaluation, and their importance for managerial decisions.  
   **A:** Price volume mix analysis evaluates how changes in prices and sales volumes individually impact total revenue, enabling managers to discern driver effects. Segment analysis breaks down sales by market segments to identify profitable or underperforming areas. Customer analysis studies sales patterns among groups to tailor marketing or product strategies. These methods support targeted decision-making, optimize resource allocation, and improve profitability by understanding underlying sales dynamics beyond aggregate numbers.  
   **External example:** Retailers use these analyses to optimize product pricing and promotional efforts for key customer segments, as demonstrated in industry reports by McKinsey & Company.

10. **Q:** What are the core steps in performing sensitivity analysis on Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) valuation, and how do variations in discount rate and cash flow growth rate impact equity value?  
    **A:** Sensitivity analysis involves varying key assumptions, principally discount rate (WACC) and long-term cash flow growth rate, to observe corresponding changes in DCF-derived equity values. By modeling a range of plausible values, analysts identify how sensitive valuation is to uncertainties. Increasing discount rates generally lower equity values by raising capital cost, while higher growth rates increase equity value by projecting greater future cash flows. This highlights valuation risk and guides more informed investment or financing decisions.

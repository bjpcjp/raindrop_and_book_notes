Interest rate models provide mathematical frameworks to predict the evolution of interest rates over time, crucial for pricing fixed-income securities and managing financial risks. Various models, including short rate models like Vasicek and CIR, and more flexible approaches like Hull-White and HJM, capture different dynamics and uncertainties in interest rate movements to aid financial institutions in informed decision-making.

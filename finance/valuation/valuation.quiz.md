1. **Q:** Describe the three stages of the Morningstar Equity Valuation Model v6 and explain how earnings before interest (EBI) plays a critical role in transitioning between these stages.  
   **A:** The model uses a three-stage discounted cash flow approach. Stage I involves explicit forecasts where analysts estimate free cash flow to the firm (FCFF) based on earnings before interest (EBI) plus net new investment (NNI). The last year's EBI in Stage I must reflect a normalized, sustainable, midcycle level of earnings as it serves as the base for Stage II and III. Stage II assumes constant EBI growth, return on new invested capital (RONIC), and a finite length, using a formula incorporating Stage I’s last EBI. Stage III models all years beyond Stage II into perpetuity, assuming RONIC equals WACC, meaning no excess returns on new capital.  
   **External example:** Damodaran’s valuation approach highlights the importance of normalized earnings for terminal value calculation in multi-stage DCF models. https://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/pdfiles/valbook/val3ed_ch6.pdf  

2. **Q:** Explain the standard formula used in Stage II valuation in the Morningstar model, including the definitions of key terms such as investment rate (IR), RONIC, and how these relate to fair value calculation.  
   **A:** Stage II value is calculated by discounting free cash flows assuming constant EBI growth (G), RONIC (return on new invested capital), and discount rate (WACC) over a finite period L. IR is the percentage of EBI reinvested in the business and equals G divided by RONIC (IR=G/RONIC). The Stage II value formula subtracts the present value of cash flows beyond Stage II from the perpetuity value, given by EBIT+1(1-IR)/(WACC-G) minus EBIT+L+1(1-IR)/[(WACC-G)(1+WACC)^L]. This captures excess returns reflecting economic moats during the “growth” phase after explicit forecasts.  
   **External example:** McKinsey’s Valuation (Goedhart et al.) uses similar concepts of reinvestment rate and return on new invested capital in multi-stage valuation models. https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/strategy-and-corporate-finance/our-insights/valuation  

3. **Q:** How does the Morningstar model define and assign systematic risk buckets for equity cost of capital, and what are the implications for companies with varying revenue cyclicality, operating leverage, and financial leverage?  
   **A:** Companies are sorted into four systematic risk buckets — Below Average (8% COE), Average (10% COE), Above Average (12% COE), and Very High (14% COE) — based on revenue cyclicality, operating leverage, and financial leverage. For instance, low cyclicality and low leverage generally result in below-average systematic risk, while high levels in these factors lead to very high systematic risk. This bucket assignment impacts the discount rate and reflects how sensitive a company’s earnings are to macroeconomic changes, ultimately affecting valuation and uncertainty ratings.  
   **External example:** Damodaran’s work on cost of capital emphasizes assessing systematic risk based on fundamental business cyclicality and leverage. http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/  

4. **Q:** What are the conditions under which Morningstar's valuation model uses alternative Stage II-III methodologies, and why must these choices be approved?  
   **A:** Alternative methodologies—terminal EV/sales, EV/EBI, EV/EBITDA multiples, or total Stage II-III value add—are used in special cases such as startups without normalized margins after a 10-year forecast, companies in declining industries with expected negative growth, resource companies with high depreciation and low capex, or firms expected to liquidate post-forecast. Approval by a director or associate director is required to ensure realistic fundamental assumptions accompany these multiples and to avoid over- or undervaluation.  
   **External example:** Aswath Damodaran discusses terminal multiples usage in valuations, highlighting special situations for alternative approaches. http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/pdfiles/valbook/val3ed_ch8.pdf  

5. **Q:** Discuss Morningstar’s approach to determining the weighted average cost of capital (WACC), emphasizing how equity, debt, and preferred stock costs and weights are calculated and adjusted in the model.  
   **A:** WACC is the weighted average of costs of equity, debt, and preferred stock. Weights use book values for debt and preferred stock and fair value for equity through an iterative process. Adjustments are made if current capital structure deviates from target long-run structure. The cost of debt and preferred stock is based on observed market rates, combining incremental and historical costs due to book-value weighting. Cost of equity is estimated simplistically via systematic risk buckets reflecting return expectations rather than traditional CAPM parameters.  
   **External example:** The CFA Institute curriculum explains WACC calculation including book vs. market weights and challenges in cost of equity estimation. https://www.cfainstitute.org/en/programs/cfa/curriculum  

6. **Q:** How does the model incorporate scenario analysis and quantify uncertainty in fair value estimates, including the treatment of symmetric versus asymmetric outcome distributions?  
   **A:** Analysts develop at least three scenarios: base, bull, and bear, where bull and bear represent the 75th and 25th percentiles respectively, assuming roughly 25% chance to outperform or underperform these. For symmetric distributions, base-case equals expected value and uncertainty is measured by the distance between bull and bear cases. For asymmetric scenarios, such as meaningful bankruptcy risk or first product launches, probability-weighted expected values replace simple averages. Uncertainty ratings controlled by scenario dispersion help indicate confidence in the fair value estimate.  
   **External example:** Scenario and sensitivity analyses are standard in valuation risk assessment, such as in Koller et al.'s valuation textbooks. https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/strategy-and-corporate-finance/our-insights/valuation  

7. **Q:** What is the rationale and implication of assuming RONIC = WACC in Stage III of the Morningstar model, and how does this affect the valuation formula and interpretation of growth?  
   **A:** Stage III assumes that companies cannot invest new capital at returns exceeding their WACC, representing the eventual erosion of economic moats. This simplifies the valuation formula to Stage III value = EBIT+L+1 / WACC, removing growth dependence in the formula since incremental growth adds no shareholder value. The firm is thus modeled as paying out all earnings as dividends with constant nominal invested capital and earnings, implying stability but no excess returns in perpetuity.  
   **External example:** This is aligned with long-term value theories where growth opportunities beyond excess returns do not create additional value; see Damodaran’s terminal value discussion. http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/pdfiles/valbook/val3ed_ch7.pdf

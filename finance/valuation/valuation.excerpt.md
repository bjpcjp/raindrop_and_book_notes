Morningstar's Equity Valuation Model version 6 utilizes a three-stage discounted cash flow methodology to estimate a company's fair value, incorporating factors such as earnings before interest, net new investment, economic moats, and cost of capital assumptions. The model emphasizes normalized midcycle earnings, systematic risk categorization for cost of equity determination, and scenario analysis to capture uncertainty in valuation outcomes.

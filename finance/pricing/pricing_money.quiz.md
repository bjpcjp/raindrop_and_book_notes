1. **Q:** How does the money market function to facilitate inter-bank lending and ensure liquidity, and what roles do collateral and central banks play within it?  
   **A:** The money market enables banks to lend excess balances on their central bank accounts to banks with shortfalls, across maturities from overnight to one year, at agreed interest rates. Collateralised lending, or repo, reduces credit risk by substituting government bonds or other assets as security, lowering interest rates. Central banks control short-term rates by influencing the cost and availability of funds, lending against collateral themselves, and requiring banks to manage their central bank accounts within reserve rules. Domestic and London (offshore) money markets exist, with the latter notably active in currencies like USD and GBP.  
   **External example:** The Federal Reserve manages liquidity through repo operations in the US money market, lending against collateral to maintain target rates. https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/openmarket.htm

2. **Q:** What is the relationship between bond prices and yields, how is this relationship affected by maturity, and how do instruments like STRIPS and inflation-linked bonds fit into this context?  
   **A:** Bond price and yield are inversely related: as price rises, yield falls, and vice versa. Longer maturities increase sensitivity to yield changes. STRIPS separate bonds into individual zero-coupon components, making pricing precise. Inflation-linked bonds adjust payments to preserve real value, paying coupons and principal tied to inflation indices, offering real yields rather than nominal yields. This diversifies fixed-income instruments and allows tailored risk exposures.  
   **External example:** Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) are inflation-indexed bonds issued by the US government, adjusting principal to inflation changes. https://www.treasurydirect.gov/instit/ti/ti_types.htm

3. **Q:** How do futures contracts function to reduce counterparty credit risk in trading underlying assets, what is their settlement mechanism, and how are futures on interest rates structured and used for hedging?  
   **A:** Futures are standardised contracts traded on exchanges with a clearing house acting as central counterparty, which eliminates counterparty credit risk between buyers and sellers. They require initial margin and variation margin, marking to market daily so gains and losses are realised immediately. Settlement can be physical (e.g., delivery of gold) or cash-settled via reference prices or fixings. Interest-rate futures settle against short-term inter-bank rates like LIBOR and are widely used to hedge or express views on future interest rate movements across maturities, often combined in strips to hedge longer periods.  
   **External example:** CME Group’s Eurodollar futures allow hedging of USD interest rate exposure with daily margining and cash settlement. https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/interest-rates/stir/eurodollar_contract_specifications.html

4. **Q:** What are interest-rate swaps, how do they function to transform fixed-rate liabilities into floating-rate liabilities (and vice versa), and what distinguishes swaps from related instruments like interest-rate futures?  
   **A:** Interest-rate swaps exchange fixed-rate interest payments for floating-rate payments (usually linked to IBORs) without exchanging principal, effectively converting the nature of interest obligations or assets. They enable issuers or investors to hedge or tailor exposures. Unlike futures, swaps are OTC instruments that are more flexible in maturity and structure but entail greater credit risk as they generally lack daily margining. Swaps are used for hedging interest-rate risk, managing liabilities, and are fundamental to the pricing of fixed vs. floating instruments.

5. **Q:** How do options on financial instruments provide asymmetric risk profiles, what factors determine an option’s price, and how are implied volatility and embedded options relevant to valuation and market practice?  
   **A:** Options grant the right, but not the obligation, to buy (call) or sell (put) an underlying asset at a predetermined strike price, enabling holders to limit downside while retaining upside potential. Option price depends on the forward price of the underlying, its volatility, time to expiry, and interest rates. Implied volatility reflects the market’s expected volatility embedded in option prices and is a crucial metric for pricing and trading options and related derivatives. Many instruments, like capped floating-rate notes or mortgage-backed securities, embed options affecting cashflows and valuations.

6. **Q:** How are forward foreign exchange rates determined using interest rate differentials, what roles do trade and capital flows play in FX markets, and how can exotic options impact short-term FX price movements?  
   **A:** Forward FX rates reflect spot rates adjusted for interest rate differentials between the two currencies, aligning with covered interest parity. FX markets facilitate trade and capital flows including cross-border investment and takeovers, with large daily volumes predominantly driven by capital movements. Exotic FX options with barriers and knockouts introduce additional supply-demand dynamics that can distort short-term FX prices as counterparties attempt to trigger or defend barrier levels, causing price movements disconnected from economic fundamentals.

7. **Q:** Who are the principal players in financial markets covered by the text, what are their primary motivations and constraints, and how do their investment and funding choices impact market structure?  
   **A:** Key players include governments (issuing mostly fixed-rate debt), supra-national entities (issuing and swapping currency risk), corporations (issuing fixed and floating debt), pension funds and insurers (long-term investors matching liabilities to fixed income), commercial banks (managing deposits, loans, and capital raising with regulatory constraints), mortgage lenders (holding interest rate risks actively hedged), central banks (managing reserves and intervening in money markets), mutual funds and hedge funds (active and passive investors), and private investors (with varied tax-sensitive behavior). Their portfolios, issuance styles, regulatory and tax environments collectively shape liquidity, pricing, and risk distribution across markets.

8. **Q:** How do the roles and incentives of proprietary traders differ within investment banks, and what disciplines and risk management practices are essential for successful prop trading?  
   **A:** Proprietary traders use a bank’s capital to generate profits through speculative positions requiring expert market insight and sound risk management. Their incentives align with profit generation but are constrained by daily risk limits and capital costs. Discipline demands prompt loss recognition and avoidance of emotional attachment to positions, ensuring trades are evaluated by current market conditions rather than initial rationale. This mitigates risk of escalating losses and supports steady profitability.
